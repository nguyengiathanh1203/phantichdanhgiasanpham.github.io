They do exactly what they say that they will do; freshen your dog's breath!<br /><br />I found them to be significantly cheaper to buy them at Amazon compared to the chain pet stores; at least $10 cheaper as of Sept. 2011.<br /><br />I have read that some dogs do not chew them well enough and have choked. I have not had that happen to my dog but it is probably something you need to take into consideration.<br /><br />My advice is to buy a smaller bag at a pet store first and see if they work for your animal. Then come back and buy them here!

I have an elderly bulldog with really bad breath. She used to swallow the original Greenies whole so I quit buying them for her. She actually does chew these and eat them and they make a big difference in how her breath smells. Great product and the price is better than I have seen it in some local pet stores.
20990,B002QWP89S,A3VVIU4JE56U4K,P. Chevalier,1,1,5,1314316800,Kinda Pricy but good!,"If you've got hard chewers (like one of our dogs), these things won't really work for the 'brushing' aspect -- they're bussted up and swallowed pretty quickly. We have three Chihuahua mixes, and they dispatched these petite ones too quickly, so we get them the next size up (small, I think). But the product is good, and they really do help a bit with breath -- although the biggest bad-breath-maker is teeth that need brushing, and there is no substitute for real brushing/cleaning.  These are good as part of the process though. We have, and will continue to purchase this product."

So I tried dental rawhide chews which he chewed just fine.  My dog is now 13 years old and he started to swallow the dental rawhide whole and would choke on them.  I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole, but I'm sure it's not good for him.  I thought I would try the Greenies again because the reviews are good and they break into bits when chewed.  I order the large Greenies for him and he loves them.  I'm not sure if they changed the taste or what, but he chews them, and hopefully it will help maintain his teeth."

He looks forward to it after his daily dental cleaning. I cut each greenie into smaller pieces, because JB (for James Bond) has long ears and he chews on the smaller pieces without letting anything fall on the floor and sticking to his ears."

I alternate their teeth cleaning chews and they love the Greenies and the Checkups best. Thanks to Amazon, I don't have to pay for S&H, which living in Alaska, usually costs a fortune!! Thank you Amazon!! I prefer to purchase from our local pet store, but they aren't able to get the Greenies or the Checkups, so I'm very happy that I can order them through Amazon."

I went to the local pet store looking for an alternative and the clerk suggested trying the dog greenies instead. I was skeptical at first so I only bought a couple of individually wrapped samples. Well, my cat absolutely loves the dog greenies! They do seem to help his breath, but I don't know how much they help the plaque and tartar build up. Oh well, it has become the only treat he likes so I will keep buying bulk boxes. I give him one every day, occasionally two, if I need to bribe him to stay inside when I open the door."

Whether or not they are good for my dog's teeth and digestive health is up in the air. All I know is that it keeps them quiet and they will do anything for them.<br /><br />I would lower the star ratings based on the fact that the manufacturer knows they have, some what, of a monopoly and charge an inordinate amount for these treats; yet, I am dumb enough to buy them so it's basically my fault.<br /><br />At least by buying on Amazon you are saving some dollar bills as compared to a traditional brick and mortar.<br /><br />My only gripe is that by the time you get to the end of the box, even if you seal the bag, they get significantly harder and I am somewhat concerned that they will splinter.<br /><br />Also, be sure to watch over your dog when he eats them, just to be safe."

I know that there have been reports of problems with dogs inhaling them without chewing them well and thus having digestion problems, but my dog savors them.  She freaks out when she knows she's going to get one and will heard whomever is getting it right to the place we store them.  She knows if we talk about them so we have to call them G's to each other.  She will tolerate other treats if I'm waiting for an order from Amazon, but she doesn't like it.  The only downfall is the price.  I can usually find a pretty good deal somewhere on Amazon and so I'll stock up on them when I can.  If I can't, she has to wait and substitute with something else."

They like them and supposedly they clean their teeth.<br />I started to give these to my dog daily, but her digestive system did not like it enough for that. Most of it seems to be digestible, but she threw up green foam on the morning after the second day in a row of eating one-a-day greenies. Note that she was also constipated as well. Greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these, so I am guess they know these side effects can occur. My dog has plenty of water available, but she didn't drink any more than normal, which may have resulted in the effects. I don't plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these. Giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects, and that what I plan on doing.<br />Not a complaint to me, but I think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from ""green."" It is pumped pull of artificial ingredients like a multivitamin. It is also made from concentrated grain protein, rather than the animal protein dogs should be getting. I personally don't feel that this is that big of a deal health wise for a creature than lives 12-18 years, but or people who invest the extra money on organic/natural dog food, you should be staying away from this product."

I gave him all some olive oil and mineral oil and massaged his colon and eventually he started pooping again.  I did notice that the greenie came out undigested!

I bought them from amazon because they were so much cheaper then at the local pet store.<br />At first, she had no interest in them. I was a little annoyed, having bought a box of 96 that was still expensive for dog treats even with the discount. She either would ignore it no matter how many times I tried reintroducing it, or take a bite then leave it. It took a few weeks and several tries, but now she loves them and eats them as soon as I give it to her. I give her at most one a day but usually one every two or three days. It hasn't upset her stomach or anything like that. The package says they aren't suitable for dogs under 6 months of age, but I stared giving them to her at about 4 months and there were no problems. She has clean, healthy teeth, but I don't think she wouldn't if I stopped giving her these. They do work in freshening her breath, however. We have a 3 year old golden retriever in the house who eats these sometimes too and has loved them since the day they came- I guess it just depends on the dog. Even though they're not the correct size for him, he's never choked and I don't think it's a problem to buy the smaller size for a larger dog.

She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.

However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them."

Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids.

I gave one to my dachshund, a short-haired 25-lb ball of energy, and he loved it.  He's 10 years old and had typical dog breath.  I'm hoping that giving these to him will not only make his breath less stinky, but also (and more importantly) help out with his teeth.  Whenever he yawns or opens his mouth wide, I can see some plaque on his rear teeth.  The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up, but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure, some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age, but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.  I'll update this according to the schedule I laid out at the very top and let you know what happens.  I've also seen lots of reviews online (not about this product, but about dog- and pet-food in general) being made out of sub par or even unhealthy materials.  I'll let you know if my dog's behavior or overall health changes as well.<br /><br />One Week<br />-------<br />My dog is still loving these things.  I feed him in the morning so I like to think these are an evening snack for him.  I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from, but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a ""U"" and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less ""heavy"".  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either, other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me, because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work, though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.  They aren't damaging to my dog's health... but to say they were helpful in improving his dental situation would be giving these too much credit.<br />My S&S shipments have been cancelled and I'm out looking for a better product."

The first time her vet was happy to see that she had a healthy ""smile"" and hoped it continued, she was still a puppy. Since then, we moved to another city and she now has a different vet. This vet was so excited, and YES i said EXCITED, to see my fur baby's gums and teeth. The vet asked to take a picture of Foxy's(my fur baby) teeth to post on their website. She asked me if i brush them daily. I said nope, we've been using greenies does that count?? She said YES and added, in detail, how healthy it is for them in A LOT of aspects. Buying them from a pet store is ridiculous to me because the price for a pack of 20 is over $19. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! So when i saw this price and the amt that come in the pack, I've been buying them on here ever since!! I give them to her once a day EVERYDAY at 9pm. She even recognizes the word ""greenies"" and follows me to the pantry when it's that time of day for her. Because of a previous review i read about storing them in the container it comes in for a while caused maggots, i got really grossed out(has NEVER happened to me) so JUST IN CASE, i dump them in a snap seal, clear, plastic container."

A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts ""dancing"" on her two back legs.

The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing ""digestive upset"" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case."

My Bella (her name) gets one of these treats about every other day since she's very difficult when it comes to me actually brushing her teeth. They definitely do the job.<br /><br />Some people have stated that their dog has choked on these treats or a piece got caught in their intestinal track. Well, I'm not sure how fast your dog tends to eat treats, or how big of a chunk they try to bite off, but that DOES matter when it comes to digestion of anything. My pup eats these treats pretty slowly (as I think she realizes it lasts longer that way), and I make sure I'm in the room while she's eating it. She'll chew off small pieces to eat, not large ones so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but I assume it would.<br /><br />I also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards, to wash it down. The person at Petsmart told me these are like crack for dogs. While I can believe that, my iggy has several different types of treats and only gets this one every other day. If I gave her this for everything, I could see it becoming an issue.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are great, they help to keep my dogs mouth clean so that I'm not having to brush her teeth quite as much."

Had to buy a tub of Greenies regular and surely enough, he sniffed at it, did his dance, grabbed it and ran away (well, he was so happy he skipped away) with it.  When I smell it, the regular definitely smells better/more appetizing whereas the LITE has the blah~ smell to it.

I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie ""yelling"" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.

Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, ""Almost three."" And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. ""No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.""<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them.

I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out."

The ONLY consistent item he eats -- including dog treats and human table food -- are Greenies treats.  The ""Senior"" variety is the perfect texture (softer than the regular Greenies treats) for his aging, sensitive teeth.  The inclusion of glucosamine and chondroitin to help with his joints give me hope that it helps the creaking and cracking of his joints.  Whatever the formula they use to make it easier to digest is a plus since I know his aging system doesn't work as well in his older years.

Use your own methods of making a control group, but be sure to see they have proper bowel movements and are not vomiting after you feed them the product.

The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.""<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding.

My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one.  My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog.

As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.

It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: ""a Greenie got stocked in his intestine"".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog."

The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies."

I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind."

23700,B0013NUGDE,A2I18AO597DSDI,"David Pearlman ""sound fanatic""",1,1,4,1280707200,A lower calorie alternative to standard chips: 120 calories/oz. A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored,"The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of ""there must be something better"".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per ""serving""), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word ""puff"" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed ""all natural"". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them."

I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of ""regular"" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor."

For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange.

They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying ""chip"" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips.

They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation ""spices"" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.

I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.

The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.

As my tastes refined in adulthood, I was less inclined to buy bags of those chips that resembled styrofoam even if I still craved their sugary sweet and salty flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips Sweet Potato chips are the adult version of the snack I grew up with. There's a delicious sweet and salty mix in every bite.  The chip is light and airy, without resembling a foamy rice cake and the deep orange hue is the color of a perfectly roasted sweet potato.<br /><br />I've purchased a number of sweet potato chips from Amazon in the past (Both the ""Terra"" & ""Food Should Taste Good"" chips) which have all been good, but they didn't play up the sweet and salty combo quite as much as I'd like. The Terra chips are more like simple sliced sweet potatoes, oven dried and turned into chips; the Food Should Taste Good chips are like yummy, sweet potato flavored, salty tortilla chips; and these Pop Chips sweet potato chips are, well... sweet potato pop chips.  If you've never had a pop chip before, the weight of an individual chip probably most resembles Baked Lays - but with a puckered, air-puffed texture.<br /><br />There are 100 calories per bag.  24 bags come nicely packed in a box that you can tear open for a neat display in your pantry.  I've purchased bagged chips online a number of times and have received packages where the chips were thrown into a box which was thrown into an Amazon box for shipping so by the time they got to me, all the chips were broken.  Not so with this packaging, they're tightly packed so the the bags don't shift around much in shipping and the few bags we've already eaten have had no more broken chips than what we'd get from picking up a bag in the store.<br /><br />Happy snacking!"

That is a fair description as the lime does heighten the taste buds and enhances the slight heat from the chili.<br /><br />My family really enjoys this flavor and it is among our favorites. We have tried most of the other varieties of Popchips and have our own preferences. My older daughter likes salt and pepper, barbecue, and this flavor the best. I like barbecue, sour cream and onion, and this flavor the best. My wife likes salt and vinegar and this flavor the best. My younger daughter does not like this flavor. She prefers barbecue, cheese, and sour cream and onion. Our least favorite is the original, probably because it is so plain by comparison.<br /><br />To me, Popchips are sort of a cross of potato chips, popcorn, and rice cakes. They are potato, but popped like popcorn and sort of puffy like rice cakes. They definitely have more flavor than many rice cakes and are a nice alternative to popcorn.

You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just ""different"" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety."

But I also have high blood pressure so a lot of snacks that I use as a treat are too high-sodium for me. I eat rice cakes with peanut butter or cottage cheese once in a while and I happened to see Popchips on Amazon.com. These <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVAWY0"">Popchips Original Potato Chips, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a> were advertised at a special price and all the flavored ones were sold out, so I decided to try the original flavor. After trying my first bag I have a few comments.<br />1. Great service - I ordered them on 1/27, and they were delivered on 2/3, with no damage to the packaging.<br />2. I like the 24-pack that are individual servings because that helps me regulate portion control.<br />3. As a previous reviewer noted they do taste somewhat like Pringles - whether that's good or bad is up to individual tastes.<br />4. The nutritional information isn't terrible: a serving has 100 calories, 3 grams of fat with no cholesterol or saturated/trans fat, and only 160 mg.sodium; Pringles also contains 160 mg of sodium but has 150 calories and 9 grams of fat, as compared to potato chips with an average of 150 calories, 180 mg. sodium, and 10 grams fat, and pretzels with 110 calories, 450 mg sodium, and 1 gram fat.<br />5. They are kind of dry and bland, but are delicious with salsa - I really liked them with Costco's peach mango salsa! I don't have cottage cheese in the house so I couldn't try that. And I think peanut butter wouldn't be good unless something ""wet"" like sugar-free jam or jelly is also added.<br />I just got them so I'm not sure if I'll reorder another box; I think I'm going to next order Amazon's 6-flavor variety pack (4 Original Potato, 4 BBQ, 4 Salt & Pepper, 4 Sea Salt & Vinegar, 4 Sour Cream & Onion, 4 Cheddar)before deciding. I would give them 3 stars if my review was just based on taste; I'm giving 4 stars because I really want to like them because they're more healthy and I can think of lots of healthy foods to use them with - why not tuna,, egg salad, etc?"

DH had a heart attack last September and, after getting two stents put in, has had to cut out all of his beloved snacks, largely due to the high fat content and sodium (especially the sodium). I've been looking for something ""snacky"" with reduced sodium that isn't awful, and these are just the ticket. One .8 ounce bag, one serving, is a nice round 100 calories with only 3g of fat (.5g polyunsaturated, 2g monounsaturated), no cholesterol, 16g carbs, and 95mg of sodium. They have a bit of a salty taste, and they aren't very sweet with only 2g of sugar. I think they'd make an interesting dip chip with a plain-yogurt-based dip.<br /><br />I liked these Popchips so much that I got the next lowest sodium kind, the Chili Lime Potato flavor with 170mg of sodium and everything else the same except 1g of fiber. DH can have no more than 1500mg of sodium per day, but considering I'm using mostly frozen vegetables and not adding any salt to anything, I think he can have a bag of these on occasion without worry. And yowie zowie! What a big burst of flavor! The Chili Lime Potato Popchips are definitely the go-to chip when you've got to have something that tastes really ""bad for you.""<br /><br />I expect we're going to be signing up to get our Popchips delivered regularly via Amazon subscription.

The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack."

I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.

The bags are hard to open but once you finally open them, of course the bag is less than half full. In my case that was a good thing. The texture is strange and light but I could get used to that. The chili lime ""flavor"" is terrible! Mostly what I taste is lime and salt. I like lime, but not that much. The so called ""chili"" flavor is almost non-existent and not enjoyable.

I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.

For example, a comparable size bag of regular potato chips would have about 130 calories and 8 g of fat.  However, these Popchips don't taste like regular potato chips.  If you like the fatty, salty flavor of regular potato chips but are trying to cut back, I would recommend a reduced fat kettle chip variety instead.<br /><br />After reviewing the ingredients of these ""natural"" Popchips, they are not as healthy as I expected.  The first two ingredients are rice flour and sweet potato FLAKES.  The remaining ingredients are tapioca starch, sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil, organic yellow corn flour, seasoning (sea salt, dried cane syrup, maltodextrin, sweet potato powder, natural flavor, citric acid), sugar, and annatto (natural color).  They contain no fiber nor vitamin A, which I would expect to find in a sweet potato product.<br /><br />All in all, the Sweet Potato Popchips are not a bad snack to munch on when compared to many other processed snacks foods.

They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are ""popped"" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag."

Now, if you've never tried Popchips before, just be aware that the texture is different than regular potato chips, somewhere between a traditional chip and a rice cake. It can throw off die-hard potato chip fans, but if you just want something crunchy and awesome tasting, without as many calories and fat, then this is going to be your new favorite snack!"

They taste great, have a quirky crunch and are low cal/fat (in relation to traditional chips).<br /><br />Sadly though I must base this review on the Chili Lime flavor I was sent through the Amazon Vine program. These are probably my least favorite flavor to date. They have the lime twang you would expect and a little chili heat (though not overly spicy) and even the potato flavor comes through. Individually these all work but somehow in this chip they really don't. Interestingly enough the aftertaste is actually better than the intial flavor of the chip itself.<br />I'm not saying this flavor is bad, it's just not that good.<br /><br />Overall, great brand with great flavors in general but Chili Lime doesn't stack up against the others."

I used to live in the UK and remember eating those delicious salt and vinegar chips. Flavor-wise these aren't as tart and vinegary as those, but they have a really nice twang to them that's not overwhelming, with some sweet/salty/savory overtones. Texture-wise these are light and airy. They are about 1/8 inch thick, like a mini rice cake though not as dense. They are great for dipping or eating all by themselves. The bag has just the right serving size. You don't feel too full afterward but they are definitely filling.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is because even though they are natural, they aren't organic, and most non-organic potatoes are GMO (genetically modified), so maybe not totally healthy, but definitely delicious!"

You will have the garlic taste in your mouth for a looooong time.<br />In spite of that, I do love the pop chips especially the barbeque(which is strong but good) and the cheddar. I also like the plain but only when I have already eaten something spicy. The other varieties aren't bad either. I like these chips because they also help my cravings and I can eat them and have been able to lose weight which I really have needed to do. Although more expensive than traditional chips, I look at it as a trade off for a more healthy lifestyle.<br /> I only gave a 4 because of the overly garlic ""parmesan garlic"" pop chips.

(a note to the makers of Popchips, however, there does need to be better quality control - I will randomly get a bag of chips that are, for lack of a better description I'll say ""harder"" than the majority of the batches I buy.)<br /><br />The Salt & Pepper variety is the flavor I love the most.

I have to say that the taste is spot on but the texture was off-putting for me. I could get used to and somewhat liked the stale cracker feel but they left an awful coating in my mouth. It was akin to plain Smartfood popcorn. I'm guessing it has something to do with the production of popped foods. Not bad but not something I'd try again. However, the two positives are that they are significantly cheaper on Amazon by almost a $1.50 per bag and have less fat content than baked. If you're a fan, this is a great choice."

At only 4 grams of fat per ounce, these are the best flavored chips I have found.<br />Buying from Amazon brings the chips to my door at less cost than buying at a local store and I don't need to spend my time or money for transportation to get them. They are well packaged in the box and each bag is sealed with a volume of air that keeps it from squashing and breaking the contents in transit.<br />All in all a great flavorful low-fat snack that hits the spot.  if there is any negative at all, it is that with 12 bags in the cabinet, I need to ration them to myself so I don't pig-out on them.

I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs. unhealthy comparison always came up negative.  With the introduction of Kettle Chips brand and widespread availibity of them and Route 11, and competition from the big manfacturers, the chip bar has been raised.  However, they haven't gotten any healthier, so I try to keep them still as a ""sometimes"" snack.<br /><br />I'd seen Popchips in the store, and had wondered if they were any good, but never made the plunge.  Amazon was offering them at a discount price, and with the other reviews adding to my curiosity, I went for it...and was happy with the results.<br /><br />Popchips have a different texture than traditional potato chips.  They are a bit fluffier with more thickness.  I'd put the texture somewhere between Munchos and a mini-rice cake.  However, they still have a satisfying potato chip crunch and potato flavor.  I am typically a salt & vinegar chip fan, but in the case of Popchips, the BBQ is the real standout.  The BBQ flavor is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, with just a little bit of tanginess.  Every friend who we've introduced to them has been pleasantly surprised and gone off to buy their own.<br /><br />If the health factor wasn't part of the equation - would I choose Popchips over Kettle Brand?  For most varieties, its probably a no - potato chips still have a great crunch that's hard to give up.  But for BBQ, I think that Popchips has it nailed - their flavor is better than any other BBQ chip I've had, so they come out on top.  And at considerably less calories and fat - it's a no brainer."

It's a pretty unique texture that's not much like what I've eaten before.<br /><br />They are not baked or fried, but popped. Which means less calories and fat. They also seem to have the ability to fill me up even though the bag is small (smaller than most I think). So that is a double win.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend trying these in store before investing in a big box of these unless you are adventurous (or generous enough to give away if they displease you)...but DO try them!"

When you open your first bag and put a popchip in your mouth and start eating it, it has a very different texture than you would expect, At-least for me, I did not know what to expect for the texture, and the first few I ate I was I was not sure if I would like it, but then the flavors started to do a happy dance in my mouth, and I got use to the texture and now I cannot get enough of these. They are very addictive, like a legal drug.. They are filling, low in calories and fat. They are my new favorite chips.<br /><br />I recommend going to the website and sending the company an email to let them know what you think of the chips. They are excited to hear what you think and may send you some coupons just for emailing them.<br /><br />If you have never tried these, do it, they are worth it. This variety pack is worth it, good price, great chips. I am eating a bag of bbq while I write this and have a bag of plain popchips waiting for me later. For a chip like this, I didn't have high expectations for the plain chips. Some low fat chips and foods that don't have seasoning taste bland and not work it, not these, even the plain chips have great flavor."

They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.

Second is the crunch that is oh-so satisfying!

They are vegan friendly, parve (no meat or dairy), and gluten free.<br /><br />The package says they are healthier because they are not fried and they are tastier because they are not baked.

The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber, vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon.

Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these ""chips"" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's ""good"" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again."

The biggest problem for me would be if I bought the large bag I would be too tempted to eat way more than a serving.  So these single sized bags are ideal.<br /><br />Also should mention that the sweet potato variety that I tried do not contain any dairy which is a necessity for me and I'm sure others have similar issues."

So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth."

So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those ""truth in advertising"" points that annoys me so I mention it."

First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.

Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're ""probably"" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a ""tomato"" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like ""Tomato and Basil"" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.

I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind."

30713,B007M83302,A2I18AO597DSDI,"David Pearlman ""sound fanatic""",1,1,4,1280707200,A lower calorie alternative to standard chips: 120 calories/oz. A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored,"The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of ""there must be something better"".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per ""serving""), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word ""puff"" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed ""all natural"". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them."

I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of ""regular"" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor."

I actually wrote to Pringles once and asked if they had any plans to make a reduced fat salt and vinegar chip...to my disappointment, they said no. For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange.

Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying ""chip"" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers. If you're looking for something with potato flavor as well as salt and vinegar, you might want to look elsewhere."

They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation ""spices"" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.

Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next."

I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.

Personally, I thought the chips were just OK, but my daughter and husband love them, so I averaged out our reviews to end up with 4 stars.<br /><br />When I first bit into a chip I found it intensely sweet but then quickly I tasted the salt and it formed a nice balance, though after eating several I did find them more sweet than salty overall. They are really very light and not at all greasy. If you are a fan of sweet potatoes, you will probably like these chips.

That is a fair description as the lime does heighten the taste buds and enhances the slight heat from the chili.<br /><br />My family really enjoys this flavor and it is among our favorites. We have tried most of the other varieties of Popchips and have our own preferences. My older daughter likes salt and pepper, barbecue, and this flavor the best. I like barbecue, sour cream and onion, and this flavor the best. My wife likes salt and vinegar and this flavor the best. My younger daughter does not like this flavor. She prefers barbecue, cheese, and sour cream and onion. Our least favorite is the original, probably because it is so plain by comparison.<br /><br />To me, Popchips are sort of a cross of potato chips, popcorn, and rice cakes. They are potato, but popped like popcorn and sort of puffy like rice cakes. They definitely have more flavor than many rice cakes and are a nice alternative to popcorn. They also can be used with dips although they never seem to last very long in our house."

You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just ""different"" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety."

These <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVAWY0"">Popchips Original Potato Chips, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a> were advertised at a special price and all the flavored ones were sold out, so I decided to try the original flavor. After trying my first bag I have a few comments.<br />1. Great service - I ordered them on 1/27, and they were delivered on 2/3, with no damage to the packaging.<br />2. I like the 24-pack that are individual servings because that helps me regulate portion control.<br />3. As a previous reviewer noted they do taste somewhat like Pringles - whether that's good or bad is up to individual tastes.<br />4. The nutritional information isn't terrible: a serving has 100 calories, 3 grams of fat with no cholesterol or saturated/trans fat, and only 160 mg.sodium; Pringles also contains 160 mg of sodium but has 150 calories and 9 grams of fat, as compared to potato chips with an average of 150 calories, 180 mg. sodium, and 10 grams fat, and pretzels with 110 calories, 450 mg sodium, and 1 gram fat.<br />5. They are kind of dry and bland, but are delicious with salsa - I really liked them with Costco's peach mango salsa! I don't have cottage cheese in the house so I couldn't try that. And I think peanut butter wouldn't be good unless something ""wet"" like sugar-free jam or jelly is also added.<br />I just got them so I'm not sure if I'll reorder another box; I think I'm going to next order Amazon's 6-flavor variety pack (4 Original Potato, 4 BBQ, 4 Salt & Pepper, 4 Sea Salt & Vinegar, 4 Sour Cream & Onion, 4 Cheddar)before deciding.

DH had a heart attack last September and, after getting two stents put in, has had to cut out all of his beloved snacks, largely due to the high fat content and sodium (especially the sodium). I've been looking for something ""snacky"" with reduced sodium that isn't awful, and these are just the ticket. One .8 ounce bag, one serving, is a nice round 100 calories with only 3g of fat (.5g polyunsaturated, 2g monounsaturated), no cholesterol, 16g carbs, and 95mg of sodium. They have a bit of a salty taste, and they aren't very sweet with only 2g of sugar. I think they'd make an interesting dip chip with a plain-yogurt-based dip.<br /><br />I liked these Popchips so much that I got the next lowest sodium kind, the Chili Lime Potato flavor with 170mg of sodium and everything else the same except 1g of fiber. DH can have no more than 1500mg of sodium per day, but considering I'm using mostly frozen vegetables and not adding any salt to anything, I think he can have a bag of these on occasion without worry.

The Chili Lime Potato Popchips are definitely the go-to chip when you've got to have something that tastes really ""bad for you.""<br /><br />I expect we're going to be signing up to get our Popchips delivered regularly via Amazon subscription.

The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack."

One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.

They have an unusual taste that is hard to describe.  It's a little on the sweet side; perhaps too sweet for some; great for others.  Popchips (any variety) are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips, but that seems like a plus to me.  They have a nicer consistency than potato chips.  I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.  The extra you pay for these is worth it if you like this style of chip.  I can't imagine anyone not liking Popchips, although perhaps not everyone would like this flavor.  Give it a try and you will most likely be hooked."

Definitely has a sweet potato flavor, so if you don't like that vegetable, you probably won't like the flavor of these.  One bag (0.8 oz or 23 g) contains 19 chips, has 100 calories, 3 g of fat, 95 mg of sodium, and 45 mg of potassium.  That isn't bad compared to many other snack foods.  For example, a comparable size bag of regular potato chips would have about 130 calories and 8 g of fat.  However, these Popchips don't taste like regular potato chips.  If you like the fatty, salty flavor of regular potato chips but are trying to cut back, I would recommend a reduced fat kettle chip variety instead.<br /><br />After reviewing the ingredients of these ""natural"" Popchips, they are not as healthy as I expected.  The first two ingredients are rice flour and sweet potato FLAKES.  The remaining ingredients are tapioca starch, sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil, organic yellow corn flour, seasoning (sea salt, dried cane syrup, maltodextrin, sweet potato powder, natural flavor, citric acid), sugar, and annatto (natural color).  They contain no fiber nor vitamin A, which I would expect to find in a sweet potato product.<br /><br />All in all, the Sweet Potato Popchips are not a bad snack to munch on when compared to many other processed snacks foods.  Obviously, something along the lines of an apple or some plain popcorn would be a healthier choice for a snack, but certainly would not be as enjoyable!"

They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are ""popped"" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag."

Now, if you've never tried Popchips before, just be aware that the texture is different than regular potato chips, somewhere between a traditional chip and a rice cake.

These are probably my least favorite flavor to date. They have the lime twang you would expect and a little chili heat (though not overly spicy) and even the potato flavor comes through. Individually these all work but somehow in this chip they really don't.

The bag has just the right serving size. You don't feel too full afterward but they are definitely filling.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is because even though they are natural, they aren't organic, and most non-organic potatoes are GMO (genetically modified), so maybe not totally healthy, but definitely delicious!"

This is a really great alternative to chips and they are really flavorful.  I typically take a sandwich to work everyday and was buying a small bag of pretzels or baked chips in the cafeteria.  I found these and they have the same texture as a chip, but have fewer calories and taste better.  After trying the variety pack, I really love the BBQ flavor the best.  My husband really loves the sea salt and vinegar flavor.  I do enjoy the cheddar potato as well, but we are subscribing to receive the BBQ and the salt and vinegar on a periodic basis since those are our favorites.  The original is rather plain, the parmesan and garlic is very garlicky, the salt and pepper is OK, but I'm just not a huge pepper fan so I'm probably not a good judge.  I really don't enjoy the sour cream and onion which is interesting because I do enjoy that flavor with other chips.<br /><br />So bottom line, great chip, great alternative to other chip options.  Low calorie, low fat, and the subscription option is really convenient since I can't seem to find the individual bag option at any store in my area."

I also like the plain but only when I have already eaten something spicy. The other varieties aren't bad either. I like these chips because they also help my cravings and I can eat them and have been able to lose weight which I really have needed to do.

(a note to the makers of Popchips, however, there does need to be better quality control - I will randomly get a bag of chips that are, for lack of a better description I'll say ""harder"" than the majority of the batches I buy.)<br /><br />The Salt & Pepper variety is the flavor I love the most.

I have to say that the taste is spot on but the texture was off-putting for me. I could get used to and somewhat liked the stale cracker feel but they left an awful coating in my mouth. It was akin to plain Smartfood popcorn. I'm guessing it has something to do with the production of popped foods. Not bad but not something I'd try again. However, the two positives are that they are significantly cheaper on Amazon by almost a $1.50 per bag and have less fat content than baked. If you're a fan, this is a great choice."

I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs. unhealthy comparison always came up negative.  With the introduction of Kettle Chips brand and widespread availibity of them and Route 11, and competition from the big manfacturers, the chip bar has been raised.  However, they haven't gotten any healthier, so I try to keep them still as a ""sometimes"" snack.<br /><br />I'd seen Popchips in the store, and had wondered if they were any good, but never made the plunge.  Amazon was offering them at a discount price, and with the other reviews adding to my curiosity, I went for it...and was happy with the results.<br /><br />Popchips have a different texture than traditional potato chips.  They are a bit fluffier with more thickness.  I'd put the texture somewhere between Munchos and a mini-rice cake.  However, they still have a satisfying potato chip crunch and potato flavor.  I am typically a salt & vinegar chip fan, but in the case of Popchips, the BBQ is the real standout.  The BBQ flavor is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, with just a little bit of tanginess.  Every friend who we've introduced to them has been pleasantly surprised and gone off to buy their own.<br /><br />If the health factor wasn't part of the equation - would I choose Popchips over Kettle Brand?  For most varieties, its probably a no - potato chips still have a great crunch that's hard to give up.  But for BBQ, I think that Popchips has it nailed - their flavor is better than any other BBQ chip I've had, so they come out on top.  And at considerably less calories and fat - it's a no brainer."

The reason I hesitated was that I took it with me to work, and the more I tried it, the more I began to question the sweetness. There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars. It is still quite good, but if you find sweetness to be cloying, you might not like this product for long. But all in all, I would still recommend it."

Harkleroad ""Tiffanys Bookshelf""",0,1,5,1327708800,I loved them!,"I am always looking for healthy, low calorie snacks, so when I heard about Popchips, I was intrigued.  They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.  This would be a great addition to a sandwich for lunch, or an in-between meal snack.  I am happy to add Popchips to my snack rotation."

They are about 7 inches across and so unbelievable crispy! We like to eat them more for fun than anything.<br /><br />So when I was offered a chance to try these PopChips, I was excited. The size of each chip is about that of a potato chip. The bag is 100 calories (3 Weight Watchers +Points if you are calculating).<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is the sweet, followed by salty of the chip. Second is the crunch that is oh-so satisfying! My 5 year old just loved them while my 8 year old wasn't so hip to the flavor.<br /><br />There is a distinct sweet potato flavor, where the sweet comes in. There are also some other spices that I can't place, but the taste is not spicy hot, is considerably salty.

With some excitement I tore open the packaging and tried the various flavors. I was met with disappointment. Texture-wise, these chips are not crunchy at all and are unsatisfying. The flavors vary from terrible to passable. I couldn't finish the pack of what they call ""salt and vinegar"" chips.<br /><br />I suppose these chips might be popular with people who are trying to watch their weight.<br /><br />An anecdote: the day after I received these I gave the rest away to the other people in my dorm (who proceeded to affirm my suspicions that these chips were subpar).

The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber, vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon.

Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these ""chips"" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's ""good"" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again."

The biggest problem for me would be if I bought the large bag I would be too tempted to eat way more than a serving.

So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth."

As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.

First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.

Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're ""probably"" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a ""tomato"" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like ""Tomato and Basil"" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now."

I could eat them by the bagful but thanks to the powers that be, this would not provide anyone with enough nutrition to survive.  Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time."

I bought these for her about two months ago when I started to be a little bothered by her breath (she's a kisser). I bought them from amazon because they were so much cheaper then at the local pet store.<br />At first, she had no interest in them. I was a little annoyed, having bought a box of 96 that was still expensive for dog treats even with the discount. She either would ignore it no matter how many times I tried reintroducing it, or take a bite then leave it. It took a few weeks and several tries, but now she loves them and eats them as soon as I give it to her. I give her at most one a day but usually one every two or three days. It hasn't upset her stomach or anything like that. The package says they aren't suitable for dogs under 6 months of age, but I stared giving them to her at about 4 months and there were no problems. She has clean, healthy teeth, but I don't think she wouldn't if I stopped giving her these. They do work in freshening her breath, however. We have a 3 year old golden retriever in the house who eats these sometimes too and has loved them since the day they came- I guess it just depends on the dog. Even though they're not the correct size for him, he's never choked and I don't think it's a problem to buy the smaller size for a larger dog.

Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them."
74735,B0026RQTGE,A33HGS0F6NVBRA,C. Kinerd,23,23,5,1232409600,Greenies - Catnip for dogs,"I have been using Greenies for years, including the older formula that reportedly had digestion problems. However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them."

She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up."

Now they practically climb up me to get to them. My older dog was having trouble with tarter and bad breathe.

She has a habit of breaking off pieces & swallowing them whole.  We have had problems with blockages & constipation as a result -- everytime she has received a rawhide.<br /><br />We have a 13 yr old Beagle which was introduced to Greenies about 2 yrs ago.  We were given a couple of the Large ones from a friend to try.  Through carelessness on our part, our dog destroyed both large treats within 15 minutes.  When we found her, we were scared figuring she would die from swallowing this large plasticky looking treat.  We quickly did some web searches & found out that the newer formula is supposed to dissolve rather easily with water.  After making sure she drank a good amount of water, we monitored her activity.  In the end, she had no problems & we were able to find a treat that is more chewable than your biscuit type treats, but safer than rawhide (at least for her).  We have tried many different treats & toys, but have NEVER had the type of response that we get from giving her a Greenie.  It seriously is like crack for dogs..."

I gave one to my dachshund, a short-haired 25-lb ball of energy, and he loved it.  He's 10 years old and had typical dog breath.  I'm hoping that giving these to him will not only make his breath less stinky, but also (and more importantly) help out with his teeth.  Whenever he yawns or opens his mouth wide, I can see some plaque on his rear teeth.  The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up, but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure, some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age, but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.  I'll update this according to the schedule I laid out at the very top and let you know what happens.  I've also seen lots of reviews online (not about this product, but about dog- and pet-food in general) being made out of sub par or even unhealthy materials.  I'll let you know if my dog's behavior or overall health changes as well.<br /><br />One Week<br />-------<br />My dog is still loving these things.  I feed him in the morning so I like to think these are an evening snack for him.  I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from, but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a ""U"" and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less ""heavy"".  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either, other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me, because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work, though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.  They aren't damaging to my dog's health... but to say they were helpful in improving his dental situation would be giving these too much credit.<br />My S&S shipments have been cancelled and I'm out looking for a better product."

However Amazon always has one great deal or another for buying these and significantly cheaper than in store prices.<br /><br />We usually buy the 130 or 96 pack of 'Teenies' for our two chihuahua mix dogs (depending whichever has the better sale price at the time.<br /><br />The teenie size is great for our smaller dog (6lb) as he can fully chew on it and savor it. However it is not quite enough for our other chihuahua mix (13lb) she tends to gulp it down like any other dog treat without getting as much benefit from the dental cleaning that Greenies are supposed to help with. Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs.

This vet was so excited, and YES i said EXCITED, to see my fur baby's gums and teeth. The vet asked to take a picture of Foxy's(my fur baby) teeth to post on their website. She asked me if i brush them daily. I said nope, we've been using greenies does that count?? She said YES and added, in detail, how healthy it is for them in A LOT of aspects. Buying them from a pet store is ridiculous to me because the price for a pack of 20 is over $19. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! So when i saw this price and the amt that come in the pack, I've been buying them on here ever since!! I give them to her once a day EVERYDAY at 9pm.

Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.

Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing ""digestive upset"" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case."

Well, I'm not sure how fast your dog tends to eat treats, or how big of a chunk they try to bite off, but that DOES matter when it comes to digestion of anything. My pup eats these treats pretty slowly (as I think she realizes it lasts longer that way), and I make sure I'm in the room while she's eating it. She'll chew off small pieces to eat, not large ones so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but I assume it would.<br /><br />I also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards, to wash it down. The person at Petsmart told me these are like crack for dogs. While I can believe that, my iggy has several different types of treats and only gets this one every other day.

I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie ""yelling"" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.

Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, ""Almost three."" And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. ""No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.""<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them.

At a little over $1.40 per treat, Greenies are more expensive than I would typically pay, but I like how they freshen his breath, clean his teeth, & are generally healthy for him.

In fact, Siberian Huskies rarely if ever bark, but if I even go near him while he's chewing on the greenie he'll starting barking at me.. and well trying to take it away is another story.

The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.

A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.""<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding.

The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.

It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: ""a Greenie got stocked in his intestine"".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog."

75213,B0026RQTGE,A22JW7FCT9ASWE,Allie,24,47,1,1253318400,Be careful with wheat gluten,"I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies."

I started with a small bag to see if he liked them which he did. He was in love with them. I noticed he had a bit more gas than usual coupled with some less solid poop, but I didnt really read to much into it. After giving him these treats he farted almost constantly! He also had diarrhea on a regular basis.Within a week of feeding him these on a regular basis he would stay in the squatting poop position for about three to five minutes every time he pooped trying to get more out. Once he got to the point that he was leaking diarrhea onto my floor it hit me. I called his vet who advised me to discontinue use of this horrid product.

We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever.

Garcia,5,6,5,1277769600,Love Love Love this stuff!,"I bought Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil from a local natural foods market after reading so many good reviews on Amazon.com and the many uses for this awesome oil on the internet. The first thing I did was put some in my dry hair to absorb for a few hours. After shampooing, my hair was MUCH softer than it was before. I've put few drops on my ends 2 more times since then and my hair is soooo soft now! In that time, I've used it as a face and body moisturizer and it does NOT make my dry acne prone face break out. Be careful though, coconut oil is not a thick oil so a little goes a loooong way (which is a great thing!). Smells SO good on my skin, gives it a slight, mild toasted coconut smell.<br />I've cooked eggs, kielbasa and pulled pork with it so far and it makes the tastes of those things richer, which is a pleasant surprise. No overpowering coconut taste, just a slight ""ummph"" to the flavor of things I've cooked so far with it.<br /><br />I even like licking the spoon after I've dipped it in the container to get some oil.<br /><br />Right now, I keep it on my kitchen counter in a cruet (oil drizzler) and it is liquid which is fine by me. Will start solidify below 75 degrees though so don't be alarmed if your clear oil starts to become cloudy every once in awhile.<br /><br />I purchased one 15 oz. jar from my local health food store for $9.99 so 2 for $12.17 is a great deal! Will purchase again :)"
189342,B001EO5Q64,A3KG5Q302QXSCD,M. Wang,7,9,4,1256688000,"Near Perfect for popcorn, experimental for other things","Edit:  Added a second part.<br />===============================================<br />Original Post<br />I use this with the whirleypop, which I'm expecting to break any minute, but that aside, this makes near perfect popcorn.  The coconut taste is a little bit stronger than what you'd find in movie theatres but overall a bit bland (which is not a bad thing).  I frankly prefer that than trading the health benefits for overly processed oil.  That and while I love coconut trading the near tasteless flavor of the oil for a strong coconut flavor would reduce it's versatility in cooking.<br /><br />So when you salt this lightly with popcorn it stands on its own.  But I season mine with kernel's seasons, splenda, sugar, some salty butter flavoring along with melted Nutiva, mixed then drizzled on top.  In short, it's one step short of heaven and the switch from Canola is immediate and amazing.  I honestly can't stop eating it and it is rather healthy in comparison to movie theatre popcorn as I use far less and still has a very similar oil fragrance and taste.  Yes I still treat it like an oil and use about 2.5 to 3 tablespoons for a 1/3 cup of unpopped corn.<br /><br />On that note, while I applaud the brave reviewers out there who put this on their hair, and eat it religiously daily this is still an oil.  Perhaps a high quality one and one I may put on my split ends one day, but to me this is a yummy cooking oil you use in moderation.<br /><br />It also is a tad expensive (hence subbing a star) and again I do find it too bland to use alone on toasted bread (perhaps it has to be toasted together in the toaster oven) but the quality and convenience is really good.<br /><br />So if you happen to use it in other ways, good on you but I am happy with using it sparingly, and simply for popcorn.  It seems much more useful to me than using it as the latest and greatest in health fads today.  Especially because oil, even when healthy, contributes a hefty amount of calories and fat to your diet.<br /><br />==========================================================<br />Note about the Coconut Oil Hype<br /><br />Seems like a few people are very into the hype, so much so that if you do not write an overly glorifying review of coconut oil something is wrong with you.  I'm not a believer in ONLY scientific studies and if that were the case I would not care for reviews by buyers from amazon.  And frankly I love you reviwers as you save me time and money.  However I do have a limit on what I hear from the internet.  And whenever there is the word ""miracle"" attached to something in the title I use a heavy amount of skepticism.  And MANY people believe coconut and coconut oil is a ""miracle"".<br /><br />Sorry folks it isn't.  I do realize all the benefits of coconut water by the way. Coconut water is extremely healthy and even used as in emergencies to substitute for human blood, but even so I would hesitate to call coconut water a ""miracle"" as drinking it alone is not a cure for aids, cancer, etc. as suggested by some. That, to me would constitute a true miracle. And if it were true, coconuts would have been discovered a long time ago as a cure for aids/cancer, etc.<br /><br />Coconut water is undoubtedly good FOR you and I love coconuts as a whole but do use some discretion when eating OIL.<br /><br />To me, if you're thin, eating fat is not so much an issue when the fat is healthier and you probably need some caloric substance. Extra virgin coconut oil, while still being researched, comes from a coconut and thusly is inherently healthy to some degree. However, if you're already overweight, then eating 3 tablespoons of oil, ANY oil, on TOP of what you eat amounts to 390+ calories extra which means you gain a pound in only 10 days.  It is VERY easy to overeat oil and that said I would really hesitate to overuse coconut oil or any oil without extensive studies.<br /><br />So those reading what I wrote, as of March 3rd, 2011 coconut oil is still being heavily studied.  Just google it if the following links do not show.<br />[...]If you're on the fence, don't consider it (or anything for that matter) a miracle until long term studies ARE done.  If it's oil, keep in mind moderation is always the key.  Don't buy the hype to eat 3 tablespoons a day if you're already overweight."
189343,B001EO5Q64,A35JFXTIZ8X1R9,Agi,2,2,5,1349222400,Delicious,"At this point I've ordered this coconut oil several time and I feel confident that Nutiva delivers a consistently excellent product. There is definitely some coconut taste due to the fact that it's a virgin product but that doesn't bother me at all. The taste and texture are alot more pleasant than other brands of coconut oil I have used in the past. I usually use it when making scrambled eggs or other assorted foods on the skillet. I can sometimes detect a little sweetness but I like it, especially with something salty. I have also used this oil to make chocolate truffles and baked goods and it has always come through like a champ. I highly recommend this as a great oil for any culinary purpose and I will definitely buy it again."
189344,B001EO5Q64,A2TVH3F0IM2UYK,kt,2,2,5,1347926400,My favorite thing ever,"I don't know how I lived so long without this stuff. This brand is leaps and bounds superior to all the other coconut oils out there. It has comparatively little greasiness on the skin and absorbs quite fast. I use it as a moisturizer, shaving cream, makeup remover, hair conditioner, scar treatment, to relive itching on bug bites, lube (no latex condoms though please), foot treatment at night, massage oil, and I even use it on my pet hedgehog for his dry skin. It has  great texture and faint coconut smell that is pleasing and not overpowering. I don't regularly eat it or use it to cook with, but I have tasted it and it is nearly flavorless. I recommend this to nearly every person I talk to."
189345,B001EO5Q64,AEY3H25KW4DL8,Brown Skin Lady,2,2,5,1344643200,Excellent coconut oil,"I keep 1 in the bathroom, 1 in the kitchen. For folks with kinky hair this is a wonderful sealant to lock moisture into your hair. Think it's most useful if placed in hair AFTER a leave-in conditioner or other moisturizer. By itself, doesn't seem to moisturize - just sort of sits on the surface, looking greasy for a while. So after you've moisturized, rub a small amount of Nutiva between your hands and then lightly work it through your hair, with attention to your ends. Give it a few minutes to soak in to avoid the soul glo look: at first it will of course be shiny, but it soaks in very quickly and then your hair just looks lush and healthy (unless you get heavy handed with it - then it will stay looking greasy. Go light...you can always add a little more later). It's also a good sealant to use on your skin after putting on body moisturizer.<br /><br />Great in the kitchen too. Can use in pretty much anything, with excellent results. Recommend using this for anything you're going to heat, and saving the olive oil for cold dishes. There are a million other uses for coconut oil, so it's worth taking some time to look into. Cold pressed, virgin, organic coconut oil is what you want. Like with most oils, this one will change consistency depending on the temperature, but even when it solidifies, it will quickly liquify again if you rub it between your hands or heat it. Price of this product seems to vary, would take a quick look to find the most reasonable deal. The scent is earthy, nutty, and not too strong - not overwhelming like chemical coconut scents. Unless you have a sensitivity to/dislike of coconut, think you will like the scent."

I like the fact it's organic extra virgin--no extra stuff added. I use this oil about as much as I do olive oil. It has a nice flavor; it's not overwhelmingly coconutish. In fact, you can barely taste the coconut--it just adds a nice, mellow flavor to your food.<br /><br />My favorite thing to use it for is popcorn! I bought the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper a few months ago, along with some Amish Country Popcorn, after a friend told me how great it was. YES! It makes the BEST popcorn (see my review for that for more details!) The oil melts nicely and quickly. It doesn't burn easily, so it's great for making foods that require high, fast heat.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!<br /><br />PS- The popcorn is Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country Gourmet Popping Corn."

Expect Greasy Delivery in Hot Weather.,"The benefits of organic Coconut Oil are endless and this brand is wonderful.  Another reviewer had warned about ordering cocounut oil in hot weather days. Coconut oil is liquid at room temperature, so it'll probably leak & evaporate from jar at 85*F+  (wildly guessing here).<br /><br />If you look at the same item in FL store shelves, their jars are kinda greasy too especially in the spring/summer months.<br /><br />I got my shipment today. Amazon did a superb job in packaging. And yet no matter how well packaged, the jars in bubble wrap, plastic bag & box, leaked the same.<br /><br />Gotta expect the oil to leak from jar while in transit in hot weather and also be prepared to do some smart cleaning upon receipt.  I suggest leaving jars in bubble wrap + bag. Place all on paper towels and put inside fridge for 1/2 hr. When oil is solid, remove wrappings. Rinse jars under warm water, use oil residue on hands, arms, face (never let a good crisis go to waste!)  Inspect lids & seals. All should be intact, maybe just a tad oily. After rinsing & once product is partially solid, there should be NO leaking from anywhere. If so, then the jar must be cracked. Remove oil and place in another container -- a glass jar would be best.<br /><br />The product is great and perhaps worth the hassle if ordering in hot days. Another option, would be to place orders in cooler months. No mess. No stress."

I decided to order the Nutiva brand because it was about half the price.  All in all I am pleased with  my purchase.  I slightly prefer the Barleans because I think it is smoother and has a fresher scent, the Nutiva smells more sweet and has a bit of a lingering smell. I have not used the Nutiva brand in cooking yet. But I love organic coconut oil and Nutiva has a great price on amazon."

I thought that was unusual, but decided to start researching coconut oil and its uses.  Wow!  This natural oil has so many uses and is extremely healthy!  It is anti-bacterial, anti-microbal, anti-viral, and anti-fungal.<br />  I've been putting it on my husband's psoriasis for three days, but it hasn't been long enough to tell yet whether it will help; I'll keep you posted.<br />  Awesome moisturizer--I've been using it for the last week as a body oil after I shower and everynight on my face before bed, and my skin is so smooth and soft!  It soaks right in as long as you use it sparingly with no greasy feeling.<br />  Natural deoderant--I found a homemade deoderant recipe on the internet today and will let you know in a later post how it works.<br />  Toothpaste Booster--Since it has anti-bacterial properties, I have been using 1/2 and 1/2 of my usual toothpaste and coconut oil to brush my teeth!  I know that sounds disgusting, but coconut oil does not feel oily in your mouth...honest!<br />  I have been taking 1T morning (with my calcium pills because it's supposed to help your body absorb nutrients more efficiently), noon and night without changing what I eat and lost two pounds in a week!  I was pleasantly surprised when I felt full for longer periods of time and was also eating less at each meal because I felt satisfied.  Another plus was that I was no longer constantly snacking in the evenings, which has been my worst habit to break but now I don't even feel like snacking!  Some people mentioned they<br />  I found my dog loves licking my skin after putting on coconut oil, so I've been researching to find out if it's good for dogs.

Unlike my other fave, evoo, it is not strong in flavor and you can fry chicken with it or use it for ""buttering"" cheese toast and although the coconut smell is stronger, the taste is sort of mildly bland, barely there at times, if you use it sparingly.<br /><br />What I absolutely love are the monounsaturated fat health benefits you derive every time you use this certified organic cold-pressed coconut oil.<br /><br />I cannot believe how absolutely positively fantastic I feel.  I wish I had thought to baste the organic Plainville farms turkey I got a few months back with this oil, I think it would have been a treat!  There are so many yummy ways you can use this oil to bring out even more flavors from you food.  My husband loved stir-fried KFC chicken breast and some frozen veggies together in lots of the coconut oil.  And I stir-fried roast Asian duck, and crispy Asian pork with this oil and some frozen veggies.<br /><br />It is versatile and although bland-tasting when used sparingly can add delicious and unique carribean or island flavor when you use it more generously.<br /><br />I love this brand and I am hooked, line and sinker on this oil.  I will be considering looking locally for their hemp and other products to compare with Amazon.com prices as well."

I also used some on my hair to see if it would stop the breakage I'm having due to medications but no change yet.

There was a hint of the coconut flavor in the finished product, but it tasted really good!  I am trying to figure out how to eat more of this oil, but I will definitely use it in place of olive oil for sauteeing vegetables.  It is safe for cooking up to 350 degrees.  It melts quickly.

I learned that coconut oil consists of predominately medium-chain fatty acids which digest more easily, are the kinds of fats in mother's milk, and are preferentially used by the liver as a source of fuel to produce energy.<br /><br />Cooking can significantly affect many fats and oils causing the formation of toxic compounds. However, coconut oil is safe for cooking because it is the oil with the largest amount of saturated fatty acids and the least amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Ninety-two percent is saturated and only 1.5 percent is polyunsaturated. You can use coconut oil for cooking without having to worry about it harming your health. It is so stable you can reheat the oil and use it several times without damaging it. Not only does coconut not form harmful toxins when heated, but it also has many health benefits.<br /><br />For more information on coconut oil benefits, I recommend Dr. Bruce Fife's books on the subject.<br /><br />I love the taste of this oil and use it almost exclusively for cooking.  I put it in our morning oatmeal for a wonderful coconut flavor and the added health benefits that it gives.  I use it in most of my baked goods, as well."

It's one of the best things in the world for you, and I make sure my son gets at least a spoonful of it a day.  Only difficulty I've had with it is that I just moved to a warmer climate, where it is 80 inside instead of 65 degrees Fahrenheit, so instead of having the consistency of butter, it stays liquid unless I put it in the fridge, where it gets hard as a rock.

It also left my popcorn machine very clean, when the other oil coated the whole machine in a greasy gunk. Combine with Eden Organics Organic popcorn kernels from Amazon for a total organic popcorn.

189418,B001EO5Q64,A1GLTKLNHO9N6T,Abran,1,1,4,1347494400,Coconut oil can seep past the new opaque white plastic Jar.,I really enjoy this oil; it's great for cooking and has many other uses as well. What I didn't like was the new upgraded opaque white jar that Nutiva now uses for the coconut oil. I have found that when coconut oil liquefies in hot weather some of the oil seeps through the bottom of the jar. I think it might be due to the process in which they make their new opaque plastic jars. There is a line in the middle where the two parts of plastic where joined together or where the plastic was molded and separated from the mold.  At the bottom of the jar the oil leaks through this mold line. In summer temperatures I have found some residual oil left at the bottom of the surface where I leave the jar. This was not a problem with the previous jars. Nutiva should address this problem right away.

While I hope that changes soon, I need to get my ""fix"".  Nutiva has a clean, lightly coconut scented product with good prices for the size. It's organic and cold pressed so heat hasn't rendered away any antioxidants and benefits. I use it like butter on bagels, and for my cooking oil. I use olive oil for salads because coconut oil is a solid under about 70 to 75. I also use it for oil pulling for dental health. I mildly dislike the plastic container but I've read that the grade is good and won't leach chemicals into the contents."

Well, ran out of Louana brand and found that I had a bit of this left from my last order.  When I opened it up the smell of coconut was a pleasant surprise.  I opened the louana tub again, no smell.  I love making popcorn with this oil and one of the things I liked was the coconut scent and flavor, mild though it is.  So I'm back on a monthly subscription service with the Nutiva again :)  It's a good value compared to others that I have looked at also."

The consensus seems to be that it has a smoother texture and stronger coconut flavor. So if you're eating it by the spoonful or spreading it on toast or want a shot in your smoothie, that would be the way to go, if you don't mind paying a little more.<br /><br />I'm mostly using coconut oil for cooking, so I like the more subtle fragrance of Nutiva. I can use it for most anything that calls for canola oil without everything tasting of coconut--mostly it just adds a certain savory quality, like umami, and makes your kitchen smell amazing.<br /><br />It's also great as a deep-conditioning treatment for hair. I leave it in for a few hours and my hair feels soft and unprocessed after washing it out with my regular shampoo. I love it because it changes the texture of my hair without weighing it down."

My mane is definitely softer to touch although it is typically not course or difficult to manage. I just got it last week so will see how it goes. The hot oil treatment with coconut oil is next on my to-do list. Careful when you use it on hair though, when I don't wrap my hair, I wake up with zits (prolly from the oil on my pillow).

I was very pleased to see that it absorbs quickly and it leaves your skin super soft. I'm prone to acne and I have yet to have a breakout from using it. It smells awesome too. I'm not sure about the effect it has on diaper rash. I think it's more for prevention than treatment.<br />  The second jar, I keep in the fridge (it stays pretty hard in the fridge)and periodically eat a small spoon of it to help my acid reflux (I'm 24 weeks pregnant) and it tastes delicious. It's just like eating coconut flakes without all the sugar.

I apply a little amount to my hair, just enough to cover it from the roots to the tips, and a little to the scalp, and let it on for a couple of hours. After that I wash my hair a couple of times to perfectly remove all the ""grease"", and for a few days, even after a one or two additional washes, my hair feels so full of body and shiny that I love it (If you have few hairs you must make the most of them!!!). Be careful: if you apply too much and do not wash your hair properly you might get the contrary effect (a greasy dead hair stuck to your scalp)<br /><br />It smells so good! just like a tropical sweet... I tasted it and it is not bad but it certainly smells better than it tastes... as a matter of fact I would say that it was almost tasteless to me. I read about the benefits of oil pulling (rinsing your mouth with it and making it pass between your teeth to remove bacteria) and it is not disgusting at all, I will continue and see how it turns out. This oil pulling alternative has also proven useful for a relative that has Alzheimer's disease as a complement to brushing his teeth, which he sometimes finds difficult to accomplish properly. Allegedly, oil pulling provides better results than using Listerine or similar mouth washes, which by the way can also be ""too spicy"" for children and the picky elderly because of their content of alcohol.<br /><br />I have also applied it over rashes in the skin and minor scratches. Many people cook with it too, although I have not tried it for cooking."
189439,B001EO5Q64,A3JVCRSVH20SLJ,Amazon Fan,1,1,5,1330473600,Excellent product!!!,"Nutiva's brand of organic EV hexane-free coconut oil is awesome. First, I admit it's the first and only one I've tried, but after reading scores of reviews and my holistic health practitioner suggesting I take in 2 Tbsp. a day, I wanted the best. And at Amazon, you get the best prices, especially with Subscribe & Save (how great is that?)!<br /><br />When I opened the jar the very first time, I was amazed at the deliciously fresh coconut aroma. It's intoxicating! I do like coconut, so that helps. But it took me a while to get up the nerve to heat it up and pour it into my frozen fruit smoothie (frozen banana, strawberries, blueberries, juice). I thought somehow it'd solidify back up and I'd get big chunk-o-fat globules in my shake. Not at all!<br /><br />When I heated it up on the stove so that it'd liquify, the scent was of toasted coconut (mmmm, so yummy), so I thought it'd taste great in my smoothie. What surprised me was that it added no taste at all. I'm now using it every day, as suggested.<br /><br />Then it took me a while to try frying with it because I figured it'd impart mild coconut flavor to my savory dishes (potatoes, chicken, eggs), which I wouldn't want. But I just tried it over the past two days, a little with scrambled eggs and a lot with searing boneless breasts of chicken (which were finished in the oven on a tray coated with more coconut oil). I tasted zero coconut flavor in any of it! I am so psyched about this! So now I'll be using organic olive oil for dressings and other raw applications and coconut oil with nearly everything else.<br /><br />Also, I read that the plastic tubs it comes in are BPA-free...fabulous! Haven't tried baking with it yet, but I did use it on my very chapped hands, and it was great. Smells like ole Hawaiian Tropic!!! I love that beach smell!<br /><br />I highly and enthusiastically recommend Nutiva Coconut Oil...it is awesome!!!!"

I've tried several brands, but nothing tastes as clean and pure as this.  There is a definite undertone of coconut, but I like the flavor, even when frying eggs or eating it on cinnamon raisin toast. I recently had bloodwork done and my HDL (the good cholesterol) was an impressive 77---anything over 39 is considered in range; over 50 is heart protective).  I attribute this great HDL number to using only coconut oil, butter, and olive oil in my cooking & drinking green tea.<br /><br />Amazon's Subscribe & Save offer is a great deal; I really like the 2 pack of these smaller (15 oz) jars.  We're a small household and I like keeping one jar sealed while using the other.  Keep in mind that coconut oil is different than other oils--it is solid at temperatures under 72, so it will look something like shortening in the wintertime.  Still tastes great and is wonderful to use in all kinds of cooking.<br /><br />One more important detail:  this is an organic, COLD PRESSED coconut oil.  Others may be organically grown, but I've found some brands are hydrogenated to make them solid at room temperature (I won't go into all the reasons this is not a ""good thing"").  Suffice it to say that any coconut oil you buy should be cold pressed (and that goes for your olive oil, as well).  Google to find out why...<br /><br />Happy eating!"

Very clean on the tongue with just a slight back hint of coconut flavour. YES, this WILL slightly flavour some of your dishes to taste faintly of coconut if the dish is not heavily spiced. When I use coconut oil in place of butter for many Ethiopian and Indian dishes, I don't really notice any coconut flavour--but these are heavily spiced cuisines and so the sheer level of spice involved will cover up the delicate coconut flavour of this oil. In baking, however, there is a wonderful little hint of it. When I've made cookies and cakes using this in place of shortening or butter, many people have commented that something felt different about the dessert, but they couldn't put their finger on it right away until I would suggest coconut. I say all of this, though, in case someone who absolutely HATES coconut is considering using coconut oil as a part of their diet. While it has many great health benefits, if you cannot stand the flavour of coconut in any shape or form, you probably will not enjoy this product. I personally enjoy the added depth and dimension is gives my food, as well as the fact it's cholesterol free.<br /><br />If you're thinking this wouldn't taste like anything, then you're thinking of what is called ""RBD coconut oil"", that is to say, coconut oil which has been refined, bleached, and deodorised. This is not that product, and in my opinion, is far superior to any RBD coconut oil you could find.<br /><br />Now, the health benefits. Coconut gets props for being cholesterol free. Many people want to downplay its wonderfulness by pointing out that it is loaded in saturated fats. However! The saturated fats found in coconut oil are mostly medium-chain fatty acids, which bind together to form medium-chain triglycerides. Medium-chain triglycerides, or MCTs, are much easier for the body to break down and process than long-chain triglycerides, which are the saturated fats that are usually predominant in our diets. Because MCTs are so easily broken down in the body, they don't put a great strain on your pancreas or digestive system. Coconut oil is not a cure-all, however. It's not some miracle food (IMO), but I do think it should be seen as a healthy, viable alternative to butter and some cooking oils. Should it replace these other oils and butter outright? No, I don't think so. But I think it deserves a place of respect alongside your butter and olive oil in the kitchen."

189449,B001EO5Q64,AGTBEWGF0VHHA,Observant I,22,23,4,1298592000,"Fresh, flavorful, and hexane-free","I've tried a few different brands of extra-virgin coconut oil, and for the most part I'm equally satisfied with them all. Despite the marketing hype, coconut oil brands within each category (virgin, refined, hydrogenated) are very similar. I should specify the qualities I look for in a coconut oil: I want a coconut oil with a rich coconut aroma and taste, maximum nutrition, and minimal processing. For these reasons, I always select an organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed oil.<br /><br />I'm pleased that this Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil provides these qualities along with an easy-to-find ""packed on"" and ""best before"" date. The jars I ordered in late January 2011 were packed on September 13, 2010, and the ""best before"" date is September 13, 2012. Stored correctly (cool, dark location, no refrigeration needed), this nutrient-dense oil stays fresh for two years. It smells and tastes great--coconutty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as ""organic."" Do a little research; ""cold-pressed,"" ""organic,"" AND ""hexane-free"" are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes.<br /><br />I'm not as pleased with the plastic jars. In fact, I took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging. I feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar, and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation.

I use it mostly for my scalp and hair because I have dry scalp and alopecia areata.  I dig out a very small amount...about a teaspoon.  I let it melt on my fingers, rub my fingers together, and then I just massage it into my scalp.  I do this at night, and wash it off in the morning.  It makes my hair feel soft.  I like to add a drop of lemon oil, lavender, primrose and/or rosemary and massage it in with the coconut oil.  It's a great all-natural stress reliever.  I have yet to use the coconut oil in cooking, but my mom says that when she was younger she used to use it for cooking (as well as her hair).  I sometimes use it for moisturizing my skin (everything but face), but it's important to rub it in very well since this is pretty greasy.  I will continue to buy this product!"

I can smell and taste a very subtle coconut smell/taste in the foods that I use it in and I thought the french fries would taste totally weird but they actually turned out super yummy. The fiance, however, says he doesn't notice any difference (I'm a super taster though, so I'm not sure which one of us is more accurate). I've replaced my vegetable oil completely with this stuff and now I can't get rid of my half bottle of useless vegetable oil..I think you can use this to replace butter in recipes as well but I haven't tried it like that yet.

It is great for cooking as a vegetable oil substitute and butter substitute in many recipes.  Of course it contains no salt, so if a recipe is counting on the salt from butter as flavor (easy example is toast), then you may want to add some salt separately.  But of course, most of us can use less salt in our diet.<br /><br />Also, this is great for dry skin.  It might take a few (5-10) minutes to absorb completely, but it works wonders."

It's a very good moisturizer and you need very little, just a few drops smoothed over the entire body; and I use it for deep cleaning my facial pores once a week (google Oil Cleaning Method). When my hair was long, I used it for pre-wash conditioning and a few drops on the ends as a leave in conditioner. I use it to massage my stretched ear piercings and to rub into scrapes and cuts I think may leave scars.<br /><br />None of these things are uses exclusive to coconut oil, I could use many different kinds of oils and fats, or different brands, but why? the bottom line is just that it's a good price for a high quality oil that fits the bill all around."

I use it in cooking sometimes, but mostly, I use it as an after-shower body and face moisturizer. I rub it all over my body and then after about 20 minutes, use a dry washcloth to very lightly blot the excess off, so when I dress, I don't get oil on my clothes. This regimen makes a world of difference for my ""chicken skin""--you know, those tiny red, raised dots a person gets on their skin when it's dry--keratosis pilaris, I believe it's called.

But I do use it in my hair for hot oil treatments and sometimes I put just a tiny bit on when my hair is frizzy to soothe it.  I have mid-back length, curly, Caucasian hair and this stuff really hydrates and softens my hair. It doesn't make your hair look greasy or flat if you use only a little bit when you have some wild frizz.  For hot oil treatments I get my hair wet then use enough to saturate my hair.  After that I walk around the house with a towel on my head (so if I lean on the furniture it doesn't make it oily) until bedtime when I shower and wash it out.  So awesome!"

So far, I have used it for (1) extremely dry skin on my face and around my hairline. I could see an improvement after just one day and it's continued until I no longer have patches of dry skin and the skin on my face is glowing. (2) I severely burnt my tongue tasting some soup and the next day it was so painful I could not eat. I coated my tongue several tiimes that day in the coconut oil and it was completely well on the third day. (3) On my grand daughters diaper rash and on her dry flaky feet. Her feet were peeling they were so dry and we cleared it up in a week with the coconut oil. (4) I coated my dry hair in the coconut oil and left it on all day and then shampooed it out before going to bed. My hair was soft and shiny the next day to the point that several people asked me what I had done to my hair. Now I regularly soak my hair in the oil and my hair is beautiful. (5) I made a face scrub with the oil and sugar and it works wonderfully for getting the dead skin off my face and feet at a fraction of the cost of the expensive scrubs and works better and smells good too.<br /><br />The oil does not stay on your skin, it is absorbed quickly and does not stain your clothes or bedding. I ordered two tubs with Subscribe and Save and the price was a real bargain except my sister begged me out of one of my tubs, so now I have to re-order quickly. I don't want to be out. I keep a small jar of the oil on my desk and use it several times a day on my hands and elbows. Those rough ugly elbows will dissappear in a week and you will have smooth white elbows if you just rub some oil in once a day.<br /><br />I have not used the oil for any kind of cooking because that is not the reason I wanted it, but I have read that it is great for use as a cooking oil. I know my grand daughter loves to stick her finger in the jar and lick the oil off. She loves it and I know it will not hurt her.<br /><br />Would I order this again? Yes and yes. I would and have it on permanent order with Subscribe and Save. I don't want to ever be without it again."

My face instantly felt smooth, moisturized, calm, and I believe it gave me an instant glow,plus I tried it in my hair it was instantly hydrated and shiny!

It sounds funny that a person would use this as you would vegetable or olive oil, but it is amazing.  I put a scoop in the pan and thought I would start slowly and try frying up some thin potato wedges to start and see what this oil was all about. It heated up quickly and the aroma was the beautiful smell of tropical coconuts.  My first concern after that was that the food would have a hint of coconut taste, but that was not the case at all.  The oil fried the potatoes perfectly.  I barely patted the potatoes. Didn't need to.  They were not greasy at all!!!!!!Nutiva organic coconut oil is my new favorite kitchen must have.  I am so impressed."
189558,B001EO5Q64,A33REC3J2JU2EL,D. Figueroa,10,10,5,1282348800,"Excellent Product, The Best Oil You Can Use","The health benefits of coconut oil have been reported widely by now. I now live in a place where there are more coconuts than people, but I brought the Nutiva Coconut Oil down here with me, because it's almost 10 dollars for half a liter here.<br /><br />I have found this brand to be the purest coconut oil on the market, at least among those I've been able to find and try. The price is fabulous, can't beat it.<br /><br />The oil will solidify at lower temperatures, it did that often when I lived in Texas. You just scoop it out and use it the same way. Once it sits in a room temp over 70 degrees, it tends to stay clear and in its liquid form. It hasn't solidified at all since I've been in subtropical Mexico. It's not white when in liquid form.<br /><br />I avoid all artificial fats and use coconut and extra virgen olive oil for most cooking and baking now. I have no problem with natural fats as I follow a mostly low-carb diet nowadays, but I still prefer non-animal sources for most fat. The fact that coconut oil has been shown to aid with lowering blood sugar is a big plus for me. I know a lot of people who stir it into their coffee or find other ways to ingest at least 3TB per day, I probably don't get that much, though I know I should.<br /><br />Be aware that this oil doesn't taste much like coconut, important for me because I LOATHE the flavor of coconut. It does smell like it, but I haven't found that it adds any taste at all to what I cook.<br /><br />A caveat: coconut oil has a smoke point that's about as low as olive oil, I believe it's 350 to 375 degrees, so this is not an oil that's suitable for deep-frying. You'll have to stick with peanut oil for that.<br /><br />I've had the second jar open for about 5 months now on the counter and have not noticed any degradation of the smell or cooking results for this oil. It should last quite well when stored unopened, as well.<br /><br />You can also use this as a moisturizer, I've tried it and it does leave my skin VERY soft."

Williams,13,14,5,1272067200,Best Brand for Coconut Oil,"Update: February 2012 I told my friend about how to use this product for cooking and how it was helpful for weight loss result - May 2012 she has lost 2 dress sizes and she has more energy.  Before this she was not able to successfully lose the weight.<br /><br />Nutiva Organic extra virgin (actually in the field of coconut oil there is no distinction between virgin and extra virgin like the grades of olive oil)is the best coconut oil brand for quality due to its true essence of coconut flavor. This is one of the very few companies that keep with the tradition of producing it cold pressed by hand which allows the oil to maintain all of its nutritional benefits.  It's not an over powering oil.  It has a clean, tropical, nutty scent and delicate flavor.<br /><br />It is good for baking, sauteeing, frying, for smoothies, spreadable on bread/pancakes, great for creating frosting, and making dipping chocolate or added with chocolate for fondue, taken orally for weight loss, lip gloss, hot oil treatment for hair, hair dress, massage oil, skin moisturizer, nail/cuticle conditioner, make up remover,  a combatant for vaginal/infections due to coconut's antiviral properties, used to moisten the inner nasal membrane to protect against dryness, and great (especially when combined with olive oil)for making bars of soap.<br /><br />Coconut oil is extremely beneficial for your health because it has both short and medium chain fatty acids which promotes weight loss, increased metabolism, and healthy skin.  Many experience the lowering of bad cholestorol while consuming.<br /><br />It is the secret ingredient I use for sauteeing broccoli and cauliflower with a hint of ginger and nutmeg.  I use it for salmon, lamb, chicken, eggs (yum), and it brings out such a dimension to food.  I prefer it to butter and olive oil in cooking when I have it on hand. My cakes, brownies, quick breads turn out moister with coconut oil and rise better. Because it liquifies beyond 72degress F it may be necessary to combine coconut oil with a heavier fat (such as butter) when baking cookies.<br /><br />Due to it's properties, coconut oil absorbs nicely into one's hair to soften it and combat frizziness.  After trying other brands of coconut oil, none has compared to the remarkable pureness and flavor of Nutiva."

I wish there was a more coconut smell, but this is how it smells naturally. I add a little coconut essential oil to help it out.

I use it in place of vegetable oils and butter (or part of the butter) in baking, and the results have been very tasty.<br /><br />The coconut flavor is light but present, so that's something to keep in mind.  Some people swear you can't taste the coconut, others say it overwhelming the base recipe.  So far, in cakes, breads, and a few candies, the flavor has been complimentary.  I like it.<br /><br />As well, it is a tad sweet, so I adjust the sweetener in my recipes down a bit more than usual.<br /><br />I live in a climate that is warm for most of the year, so the EVCO stays liquid. Though it is shelf-stable, it may be worth considering how you would need to store it, based on your climate, before you buy.  This particular container size is very manageable to handle on the shelf, and it doesn't take up a lot of room in the fridge.<br /><br />I'm really happy with this product.

Even though it's oil, it doesn't make me break out (I tend to have oily skin) and I have rosacea, so I like the fact that it's natural. I've also used it as a deep conditioner on my hair with positive results. The smell is intoxicating, but not overwhelming, reminds me of Hawaii. It's great on any body part that is dry, feet especially. I even got my Mom on board, who has overly sensitive skin and she really likes it as well. Very happy that I found Nutiva."

It tastes good in the mouth and after swishing for 15 minutes each night it seems to have helped my gums feel better and brushing no longer hurts the gums. But I also changed a few things in my routine like using Sensodyne Pronamel tooth paste (big help) and the new Cinnamon Listerine Total care. - I have not used to oil/paste for cooking at all but I can see it being great for baking and using in sweets that call for oils. For oral care it takes about 1 minute to turn into an oil in your mouth and leaves your mouth tasting nice and sweet. So before romantic night of kissing I would highly recommend this paste prior to kissing! Just be sure you do not swallow this stuff as it is very high in fat but if you are constipated it will help ""ease your troubles"" if you do swallow some of it."

Mono fats like olive and coconut are healthier fats than even sunflower, vegetable, and canola oils, however olive oil doesn't tolerate the higher heats for frying/pan frying and some people don't like the way it tastes in baked goods.  Coconut oil doesn't contribute to slowing of the thyroid like vegetable oils can and tolerates the higher heats of frying that olive oils can't.  It imparts a light tasty coconutty flavor to baked goods.  I just wish it came in more user friendly packaging.  Convenient 1/2 cup portions within a larger container for instance would be great."

Before we realized it, we had made a batch of carb-free chocolate candy with cream cheese and coconut frosting, a huge batch of chicken fried in the oil and a huge batch of faux-potatoes using the oil.  We had to throw everything away.  The taste was atrocious.  Everything had a burnt and bitter taste to it.  I'm extremely disappointed and according to my 15 year old daughter, they need to hire better quality control employees.<br /><br />I have to post an update to this review because I've been working with a customer service rep today and he has provided fantastic service.  He is shipping me, for free, a replacement product as well as some additional free products.  I am also sending the remaining jar back to the company, at no cost to me, for additional research."
189662,B001EO5Q64,A2GCVCOQXGL8YA,Savvy Skeptic,8,8,4,1307491200,Smart and Savory,"I used to cook with coconut oil years ago, but gave it up when the ""experts"" said it was bad for your health. I started cooking with ""healthier"" alternatives--like artificial sweeteners and chemical-loaded, aerosol-powered, partially hydrogenated cooking sprays--also on the advice of the experts.  My food tasted like a tin can, my skin was an oily mess, I felt sluggish all the time, and my jeans hugged me ever more tightly. Thankfully, the conventional wisdom has come full circle, and I've spent the last few years making the grateful journey back to a more natural--and genuinely healthy--way of living. I looked for a good, organic coconut oil at our regular grocer with no luck, so I was glad to find this brand here on Amazon.  I'll agree with some of the other reviewers that say this oil has a ""toasty"" scent.  It does, and that's why I like it.  Its warm, toasty aroma actually smells a little buttery--which is perfect if you're using this as a substitute for butter or margarine.  I've tried other oils that have a more coconut-y aroma, and they also had a sweeter, pronounced fruit-oil flavor that's great for desserts and dressings--but clashed with meats and savory dishes. This coconut oil and EVOO now get nearly equal time in my day-to-day cooking, and the warm ""toastiness"" of this oil adds a richness that enhances other flavors. I can't see it working in place of butter on something like toast or popcorn, but cooking with it gives a noticeably buttery taste to foods. This came in a pack of two tubs, which is convenient since this oil has so many uses. I can have one in the fridge to keep it solid for cosmetic/medicinal use, and the other in the cabinet as an ever-ready liquid for cooking. I'm once again enjoying all the benefits of virgin coconut oil--health, nutrition, beauty, and flavor all in one jar. These containers are fairly small, so if you use this as one of your staple oils, you may want to get a bigger size."

Squirrel""",8,8,5,1297036800,"Yummy for skin, and your palate!","(I thought I had reviewed this product already, but perhaps it was under a different size? Oh, well)<br /><br />With apologies for possible redundancy, I will simply say that this stuff is fantastic.<br /><br />Other reviewers have written about the ""clean"" taste, and I can say that after tasting this product, I wholeheartedly agree. It just tastes fresh.<br /><br />And it melts in your hand. And tastes terrific in food.<br /><br />It DOES have a delicious fresh scent, but make no mistake, it does NOT smell like suntan oil. If you wear it on your skin, you will not smell like the stuff that comes in a brown bottle. It actually fades relatively quickly, but no one will accuse you of rolling around in coconuts.<br /><br />Same goes for putting in food. I think it adds a nice depth and nuttiness, and is yummy in popcorn, as some have stated. But it is absolute HEAVEN in your fried brekkie potatoes.<br /><br />Think it is also worth mentioning that to the lower ratings reviewers, I think that ordering this product in the cooler months has merit. If it becomes liquid at 75-ish degrees, I can see that it would be easy for this stuff to leak, despite what appears to be the best efforts on the part of the manufacturer when it comes to the packaging.<br /><br />Finally, I think that the 15 oz size is fine if you are going to be using this product for topical use only, but if you plan on cooking with it as well, I would recommend getting a larger size-<br /><br />Can't wait to use this during the summer, and show off my glowing skin!<br /><br />Hope this helps!"

Newton ""coffee lover""",8,8,5,1296345600,Love this product!,"This is the first time I have ever used coconut oil and I love it!<br /><br />I first tried cooking with it--I used one tablespoon in the pan, added onion, garlic, mushrooms and peppers.  I usually use EVOO so I was a bit worried about the taste difference.  It defininely smells like coconut, but surprisingly, it is not overly strong.  The taste was pleasant with my veggies.  First try: delicious and easy.<br /><br />Next, I put some on my face as a moisturizer.  Again, the smell was pleasant and mild.  In the past I have also used EVOO on my skin because it is a milder moisturizer than a store bought facial moisturizer.  EVOO takes hours and hours to soak in, so I only use it at night before bed.  I thought the coconut oil would be similar.  I put in on in the evening and sat down to watch a movie.  It was completely absorbed before I even hit the sheets!  And by the time it was absorbed, the smell was gone (not that the smell of coconut on the skin would be a bad thing!) So it is lovely as a facial moisturizer.<br /><br />Then I read on the label that it could be used in place of butter, so I spread some on a cracker and tried it that way.  It was delicious!  I love the oily texture--similar to butter, with the coconut taste.  So it is a wonderful substitute for butter.<br /><br />I am sure I will find more uses for this incredible product and I can't wait to try it again."

I am 39 years old and at the age where health is something that is starting to become very important to me, as I am starting to see more and more friends and school mates with various health issues.. I have never had any health complaints and have decided to be proactive about health matters, instead of trying to ""fix"" them as they come along (as long as I'm able, of course). So, in my hours and hours of reading, I came across so many articles, websites and books devoted to coconut oil. I was shocked, that I have never heard of it and I have still not met anyone who uses it.<br /><br />So, I decided I had to try it! The main reason was I read that eating 2-4 teaspoons a day had health benefits, but I have also came across my fair share of home spa recipes for moisturizers using coconut oil as one of there main ingredients. I figured, I couldn't go wrong buying it, because if it didn't taste nice, I could still use it. I'm very happy to report that I was blown away by the taste of this coconut oil! It is not sweet at all but the coconut oil was so reminiscent of a Almond Joy candy bar to me, that I find myself going back for another spoon just to enjoy the delicious flavor..  I'm afraid I'm going to have to reorder more to use in my moisturizer recipes, as I intend to use these two containers to cook with now that I am hooked on this fantastic product.! I would recommend this coconut oil to everyone because of it's many health benefits and versatility of use (You can spread it on your toast it tastes so great or cook with it as you would any cooking oil, as well as use it on your skin. Google Coconut oil moisturizer recipes, cooking recipes and also health benefits for yourself as well as the  health benefits for your dogs if you have pets. You will be amazed at all the interesting information on the web about coconut oil))! Unless you truly dislike coconuts I think you will find, like me, that you now have a new favorite oil!"

I'm originally from the West Indies so needless to say I love coconut.  I've tried other extra virgin coconut oils and wasn't impressed, they tasted and smelled more like vegetable oil than anything, and forget about trying them straight.  I was very skeptical about Nutiva but reading some good reviews and being hounded by my vegetarian friend who swears by it, I said what the hell.  It arrived from Amazon and it was in liquid form, which was to be expected as it's 96' in the shade here in Florida.  I removed the lid off the jar and before I even took the seal off, I was entranced by this wondeful coconut fragrance.  I stuck my finger in and even in liquid form, I was tasting nothing but melted coconut.  Later, when it turned into solid form I tried it again, a dap on a teaspoon, once again, nothing but coconut.  Definitely will buy this coconut oil again.  Nutiva did a great job of impressing an Islander ;)"

Well....i was WRONG! There is no sugar taste to this stuff at all! It does have a very strong smell of coconut though, and not much flavor to it.<br /><br />I bought this stuff because of some Candida overgrowth issues I've had recently been dealing with (which was caused by too many antibiotics given to me by my doctor) and also for a new found minor eczema problem (probably caused by the Candida overgrowth).<br /><br />So basically I eat and rub this stuff on me all day. Lol.<br /><br />I love the added taste it gives to coffee or tea. It says it can be used as a 'buttery spread on bread' but I can't imagine actually substituting butter for this stuff.<br /><br />I have yet to cook with it, but I'm sure it will work fine.<br /><br />My stomach problems I've been having have seemed to have cleared up.<br /><br />As far as the eczema, it seems to be helping a bit, but not as quickly as Dermarest Eczema lotion did.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RTU4GE"">Dermarest Eczema Medicated Lotion 4 fl oz (118 ml)</a><br /><br />I still find myself scratching a bit, but not nearly as much as before and redness or bumps are gone. However, I am still going to keep using this for my eczema because it is more natural way of clearing it up. After using the Dermarest lotion a few days my heart started pumping slow and hard.<br /><br />One more thing I should mention (why I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5) is because I keep forgetting that this stuff melts once it reaches 76 degrees. I inadvertently opened the jar on an angle one day thinking the coconut was still solid and the oil spilled out everywhere!! Definately my own fault, but the jar itself doesn't seem to be the best thing for containing such an oily liquid when it melts. This still would not stop me from purchasing this specific brand though, just don't be an idiot like me and you will be fine.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this brand as I've seen others in stores and they cost about 12 for 1 jar. Amazon had 2 jars for 12. Can't beat that! +++"

I had a much larger container before but it turned before I used it all up, we live in a hot climate so this is a great size to insure it stays fresh.

It tastes great and is wonderful for baking when you want a little coconut flavor substitute it for the oil in the recipe. Great for curry and sambal recipes. Just know that it solidifies if it gets cold so as a salad oil it's not good because it gets hard when it hits cold food. It will do this when used as a marinade on cold seafood or meat but thats a good thing in that case because it stays hardened on the food till you get it on the grill and then it melts into it making it really tasty!

This oil is a WONDERFUL moisturizer, and I use it every time I wash my hair - sometimes between washes, if it's an extended time. My hair has never felt so healthy and... not-dry. And after this, I began to wonder what else it was good for. I also discovered it's good as a low-cost additive in paint (oil or acrylic) that keeps the application smooth and elegant.<br /><br />So!

I bought the pack of two 15 ounce jars, one for cooking and one for the cat's food, my own body, and my hair, and it's just heavenly.  It smells brilliant on, but the smell fades after awhile so it doesn't totally overpower you and everything around you, my cat likes it so much that he licks it off my legs--he needs a bit of extra fat since the raw meat you get at the grocery is generally lean--and my incredibly picky boyfriend tried some teriyaki pork I saut&eacute;ed in coconut butter and he loved it--huge surprise, since I was ready to go overboard apologizing to him for the coconut flavor.  I've made raw truffles with this, carob powder, almond extract, agave, and crushed almonds, and they turned out so yummy that SAD eaters loved them.  But--warning!--if you live in the South, and especially in the summer, be really, really careful peeling the protective bit of plastic on the top off!  Mine is permanently liquid, but especially so when it sat outside in a box waiting for me to come home.<br /><br />Another bit of advice:  buy the 54 ounces; it's a better buy, and you'll use it!<br /><br />To whoever hated the plastic jars:  yeah, you're right, but I'd still buy this coconut oil again.  No, plastic isn't ideal, but I just transfer the oil to my old glass olive oil bottles and add one of the metal dispensers on the top--easy to use and it's glass."

It has only a subtle coconut scent, which is excellent for low-heat cooking. Although it is recommended for slightly higher heat, the risk of burning the oil is high, yielding an awful synthetic taste and smell.<br /><br />I use coconut oil in my raw vegan desserts. Unfortunately, I live in Florida, which means that the coconut oil itself is always in a liquid state when kept at room temperature. Be forewarned that in the warmer months, you will have a liquid oil, since it ""melts"" at 73 degrees Fahrenheit (23 C). If I make a raw cheesecake, it needs to be refrigerated immediately and cannot sit on the counter for very long, But it still does an excellent job! It is also great for the hair and skin; I keep a separate bottle in the bathroom for such uses. I have sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out, and the gentle moisturizing properties of the coconut oil do not irritate my skin or pores at all.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this product, after months of receiving it, was that it was shipped to me once with an open lid. When I received the box, it was coated in oil with a sticker from the post office that it had been received damaged by them (the postal carrier would not even carry it up for me), and damaged a box of books I had shipped separately. However, Amazon was very quick to rectify the issue.<br /><br />A few other reviewers have complained that the oil ""sweats"" and no matter what they do, the outside of the jar becomes oily. I've been through about 6 bottles of oil over the years and have only had this problem when I didn't wipe the bottle off after use. Scoop the oil out with a spoon (don't pour it from the bottle!) and you won't have a problem."

There was a piece of day old Rosemary Bread on the counter.  I remembered so many people saying this tastes good on bread so I decided to try it.  I admit I stood my the garbage pail because I was expecting to throw the piece of bread with coconut oil spread on it away.  I love this stuff but didn't think I'd go so far as to eat it straight out of the jar.  Wow.  It had a nice smooth buttery taste.  Ate it all.  By the way, Subscribe and Save is the way to go.  Doing it for a year now.  Very satisified with the service.<br /><br />Besides the cooking benefits of coconut oil I've discovered other benefits that make this a must have in my house.  For more years than I can remember I had a wart on one of my fingers.  It would come and go but finally got to the point that when it flaired up it would split, bleed, and get infected.  It was getting very hard to keep under control so had decided that I would finally have to go to a specialist and have it removed.  The last time I had an episode with it I decided to try one last thing...coconut oil. I had read coconut oil had anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties.  Within 2 days the infection had started to clear up.  In less than 10 days the wart had shrunk to practically nothing.  It's been months now.  I use coconut oil on my hands every day...several times a day and haven't had a single new flair up.  After dealing with this for more than 15 years, I can barely feel where the wart was. I've used coconut oil on burns, cold sores, and callused feet (smooth as can be now).  It's also wonderful for keeping my gray hair very soft and manageable.  I had read an article about ""oil pulling"" and tryed it with coconut oil.  I won't go into that here.  Just go to Bing or EHow and check it out.  It has really improved my oral health.  The articles I read suggested oil pulling with sesame oil but I used coconut oil because of it's anti-bacterial qualities.  This is a product I wouldn't be without now."

It generated a good discussion spanning 97 comments, however it was not very concise and I wished I had made my points more clearly. This is a rewrite of my initial review.<br /><br />I purchased this product because I had heard stories in the popular media about how coconut oil contains a healthy form of saturated fat. I welcomed this news because coconut oil is a fun ingredient. It has a high smoke point, a great taste, and does not go rancid.<br /><br />As a chemist, the hypothesis for why it may be healthier made sense to me. Coconut oil contains medium chain saturated fats, which differ from the long chain saturated fats found in red meat. I studied lipid transport during my PhD and I think it is totally possible the body does different things with these two different chemicals.<br /><br />However it is also totally possible that the two types of saturated fat both increase one's risk of cardiovascular disease. To figure this out, I looked through the literature and spoke with people to see what proof there was.<br /><br />What I found was that the arguments that suggest medium chain saturated fats are health appeared flawed to me. Here are the arguments I have heard:<br /><br />Some people reference studies of island dwelling-people who eat diets rich in coconut fats. These people have low rates of heart disease. The problems with these studies are significant. First, these people often die earlier than Westerners, and that is why they have lower cardiovascular disease. They have lower rates of Alzheimer's disease too. This is because of the second, larger problem: there are MANY things about the life of an island-dwelling person that is different than that of a Westerner. Maybe the diet is the cause of an observed effect, maybe it is the increased exercise or different sleep pattern. You just can't draw conclusions when so many variables have changed. Islanders are just too different to use as a model.<br /><br />Some people trust books written about the subject like ""The Coconut Oil Miracle"" or ""The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil"". The problem with these books is that they are books, not studies. To prove something, you have to perform a study. To make their arguments, they often cite studies, but the studies are like the one above, typically flawed. There isn't a paper published that shows medium chain saturated fats do not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease the way saturated fats do.<br /><br />There have also been citations from doctors such as Dr. Mercola. It is best to take advice from leaders in the field, rather than doctors trying to sell a book or treatement. Specifically Dr. Mercola has been admonished by the FDA for making misleading claims:  [...] Be careful who you trust.<br /><br />Ultimately, there is no evidence that medium chain saturated fats have different health effects than saturated fats. The most convincing argument in favor of coconut oil is that saturated fats themselves are not dangerous. There is controversy on this subject (just like with most medical subjects) but the vast majority of the data supports the idea that saturated fat increases your risk of cardiovascular disease. To support this, here are some sources.<br /><br />1) Harvard University School of Public Health published this easy guide to fats and cholesterol:<br />[...]<br />Here they recommend that you should not decrease fat intake overall, just replace saturated fats with unsaturated, the less saturated the better.<br />2) The most convincing paper on this subject says this:<br />""Based on consistent evidence from human studies, replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat modestly lowers coronary heart disease risk, with ~10% risk reduction for a 5% energy substitution; whereas replacing saturated fat with carbohydrate has no benefit and replacing saturated fat with monounsaturated fat has uncertain effects. ""<br /> To restate this, if you replace saturated fat with polysaturated fat, you will reduce your risk of heard disease. The authors say a 10% risk reduction is modest, but consider that you are most likely to die for a heart attack so a 10% risk reduction is quite welcome in my opinion.<br />Further research has shown ""The meta-analysis of the trials showed that increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption as a replacement for saturated fat reduced the risk of coronary heart disease events by 19%."" That is a huge effect.<br />Citation is here:<br />Lipids. 2010 Oct;45(10):893-905. Epub 2010 Mar 31.<br />Saturated fat and cardiometabolic risk factors, coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes: a fresh look at the evidence.<br />Micha R, Mozaffarian D.<br />Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA.<br />3) Finally here is a list of all the studies done on the subject, what you will find is that, while the topic is controversial, it is not a 50/50 toss-up. The majority of studies find saturated fat to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.<br />[...]<br /><br />To summarize what I learned from these conversations and articles, I now know that there is no proof that medium chain saturated fats behave differently than long chain saturated fats, and I know saturated fats likely increase your risk of cardiovascular disease as much as 19%.<br /><br />I decided to take the more conservative path and I sold the coconut oil I bought, hopefully to someone who plans on using it in some other way besides eating it. I hope to realize the health benefits associated with replacing saturated fats in my diet with polyunsaturated fats."

Shelnutt ""Mystery Novelist""",4,7,5,1273968000,"Alive, Ageless, Gourmet and Gathering Years","<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 9:15 Mins<br /><br /></span>Some say the COCONUT palm is the Tree of Life.  They say Life is honored and perpetuated through its meat, its water, its oil, its presence.  Purchased from Swanson, my favorite purveyor of health products, this coconut oil is one of the highest qualities of life healing offerings available from this sacred gift of a tree.  I had sensed this cold pressed oil's uncanny value as soon as I saw a picture of the jar on Swanson's product list on Amazon.  I had come to trust this company [as much as I continue to trust Amazon] from purchases of several types of magnesium supplements including <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026RCMAG"">Magnesium Oil 8 fl oz (237 ml) Spray</a>.  From reading Bruce Fife's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q360CS"">The Coconut Oil Miracle</a> I clarified my belief in the healing nutrition in coconut oil and in this brand's production purity.  My experience of using this product for only 24 hours had shown results which have made me feel blessed... finally!<br /><br />I've been slowly and steadily rectifying a serious magnesium deficiency while searching for what felt like a missing catalyst or synergistic essence which would cause magnesium supplementation to be accepted by the body, and then ultimately seated into the cellular level of life enhancing operations.  Dr. Carolyn Dean's book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ODEPY4"">The Magnesium Miracle</a> is an excellent guide to Magnesium's magic in healing, normalizing, and strengthening the embodied human soul.  I've been thinking that coconut, in its several forms of use, can work as magnesium's ultimate catalyst.  What a team!!<br /><br />To understand the vital message in what I'm trying to say here, please be cajoled or even coerced (jokingly) into reading some of my reviews on magnesium products along with the two books linked above... as a start on a journey to understanding, appreciating, and relishing LIFE.  Other great books and products of Magnesium and Coconut are available on Amazon, found easily using the search capacity.<br /><br />According to experts, the most important thing to know about oils and coconut products is that they should be gently, minimally, and carefully processed by cold pressing, preferably labeled ANH (absolutely no heat used in processing); the reasons for this are detailed clearly in Fife's book.<br /><br />Also according to experts, the most important thing to know about magnesium is that it needs to be held in highest priority and percentage in the minerals taken into the body, and that certain foods and additives defeat bio-availability of magnesium.  Especially calcium needs to be taken in much lower amounts than Mg, and in current food market and habits is usually supplied in quantities much too large, causing many illnesses related to calcification or deposits, and contributing to magnesium deficiency.  This is clearly detailed in Dr. Dean's book.<br /><br />My main concern with coconut usage for persons severely deficient in magnesium [like I am] is that in its current state that fruit holds more potassium than magnesium, which could upset the balance and primary necessity of magnesium.  In my non-professional opinion magnesium is the INDEX nutritional substance; the A-Priori for Life.  Maybe even the Tree of Life needs magnesium as its priority nutrient. With adequate magnesium held within the cell structures... [some books say cells need to retain 10,000 times more magnesium than any other mineral]... the body can adequately and correctly utilize other minerals and necessary foods, in order to live strong and disease free.

Coconut oil is a high heat oil so it won't burn your food like lower heat oils. Use freely for sauteing, frying and anywhere the coconut flavor is a plus. It's not overwhelming in flavor, just subtle. I've used it to deep fry battered fish and yum, so tasty. Also use it to make popcorn. Your popcorn won't burn and you'll get a really nice flavor. And, of course, you can use it on your skin, hair, etc. There are many benefits to coconut oil."

Well, I don't like using it in place of butter. It is very tasty with no phony aftertaste or anything. I have used it when making certain things on the stove where I would use butter. Mostly I use it for items that are on the sweeter side. It's very good on toast too. Almost like having dessert!<br /><br />In the winter, I get very dry elbows. I have one of the jars in my bedroom so I can just apply to my skin whenever I want. It's not greasy which surprised me. I thought it would be everywhere. It soaks right into your skin. In the reviews on QVC (I believe), there are women using this exact product on their face. That's just not my thing. I think the sweetness of the smell would bother my nose due to sensitivities to smells. Anyway, it fixes my elbows up with a couple of days; I only apply it in the morning and at bedtime.

Anyway, I had quite a rash, and did not know at the time this was it. I tried medicated powders, diaper rash cream - thinking it may be heat rash. One night the itch was so bad, I decided to put coconut oil on it. Wow- the itch stopped and I slept through the night. Since then, two relatives came down with scabies. They went the chemical route via their doctor. I never did. As I researched this I think one of the reasons coconut oil works for me is that the oil smothers the little critters. Instead of chemically killing them, I am drowning them in coconut oil. Plus so what if the oil gets into my blood stream! My rashes healed, my skin is soft. Now the scabies take a while to leave your body, but I just kept a small container of coconut oil and if I feel an itch, I apply it there. I also read that if you put TEA TREE Oil or Clove oil ( a few drops) and use coconut oil as a carrier it may really kill scabies. So I am using a bit of Tea Tree Oil just in case, but I feel I was being cured just by using the coconut oil.<br />I gave it four stars because of the plastic container. However, I read this plastic is the safe kind. BUt it still makes me a bit concerned....."

Leaves me feeling a little queasy. Otherwise its a nice oil and I can buy it at the local Martians grocery store. I can't eat it alone and even in my morning oatmeal its still to much. If you love an over powering taste and smell of coconut you will probably love this product if you don't then pass on this one.
189841,B001EO5Q64,A2T0V99GLGXWCM,Ghost(Ghost(M)),5,13,4,1291766400,OK stuff if used within reason.,"First, I'm not sure why it's called ""oil"": it's butter, not oil; it's solid w/o refrigeration. The consistency is translucent sorta clunky white, sorta like grated candle would look. Just like butter, it immediately melts in your hand or mouth, to say nothing of the frying pan. Smells great, tastes also nice: like, well, coconut. Supposedly it's great for cooking due to its supposedly higher heat-resistance something: it's supposed to keep its nutritional qualities when heated better than other common cooking oils. There's a rub though: with many foods you can mix and match and achieve some sort of mixed flavour -- not with this stuff! It's irrepressible: whatever you add it to -- veggies, cakes, meat, cardboard, or motor oil -- will then smell/taste like coconut and nothing beside. It overpowers every other flavour. So the only cooking variables you have left when using it is texture and sweetness (and looks, I guess). It goes very well with something that's sweet (probably because we're used to coconut being used in sweets). From what I've tried, it goes well with carrots, apples, sunflower seeds (anything nutty-tasting), stuff like that. Real good with sweet potatoes. But I would not recommed using it for cooking meat (unless you like your pork chops smelling and tasting like coconut). You can't kill this flavour, that's what I'm getting at. I'm using it carefully (not too much and in suitable combinations) and I'm happy with it so far. The product seems good, and so is the price (Added on 12/18/2010: that was the price at the time of purchase, $13.54 on Dec 2, 2010 -- and now, only two weeks later, the price on this page is $18.46, amazing, no? A 30% increase in two weeks, wow, these guys sure are optimistic about the value of their product).<br /><br />A bit of a warning: there's a megaton of unsubstantiated semi-literate BS online about miraculous powers of coconut oil. Be careful about it: coconut oil is pure saturated fat (a serving consists of 14 grams of fat, 13 of them saturated) -- and I've found no acceptable medical/scientific info in support of the healthfulness of saturated fat (while there's a lot on the opposite). What I did find was that it's not openly harmful when used in small doses: a healthy 200-lbs 40-sh male, not overweight and exercising regularly, is allowed 200 saturated-fat calories a day. A serving of coconut oil is 130 calories, but of course, you'll get saturated fats from other foods too. Another thing is that coconut oil contains no appreciable amounts of vitamins/minerals (unlike butter, which is _loaded_ with all kinds of goodies). So be careful: despite the squall of shilling on the net and in print, it's not health food. But it's tasty and not like lethally bad, so...<br />-------<br />Added on 12/18/2010: I'm half-way through the first jar, and I find myself using it less and less. It's too smelly, and I just don't have that much opportunity to use it for stuff where it's OK. Besides being food, it is supposedly also good for external use, for skin and hair; I haven't tried it this way (yet; maybe I will). But I have a feeling that _as food_ it doesn't have much of a future in this household: it's too overpowering, too particular.<br />-----<br />01/01/2011: Tried it for skin lotion: well, um, yes and no. No: it doesn't get absorbed into the skin, and the area of application stays greasy forever, so you can't do it before going out (even wiping with, say, paper towel, doesn't remove enough of it, so you'll stain the clothes with oil). Yes: it has a terrific staying power, hours and several hand washes after application there's still something remaining on the skin. And I work with my hands a lot, with the result that they tend to get real dirty, so I wash hands frequently and rather severely, the surgical way: very hot water, several soap-ups, brush. This causes severe dehydration of the skin, so I've always used hand lotion immediately after, but with coconut oil the skin remains slightly oiled, soft and moisturised even after a couple of such washes.<br /><br />So, finally: I'm not sure how (and whether) I'll continue to use coconut oil: I have definitely ceased to use it as food; as moisturiser we'll see... at least it's marginally cheaper than dry-skin cream so I'll give it a longer try. But the cream dries up in a minute, so it's more practicable, I must say. Doesn't smell of coconut either! :-) I must say I did not find the product as useful as it's hyped, so I'm taking one star off right now. I'll revisit in a month or two: if I discover by then that I've stopped using this thing altogether, I'll update the review to this effect.<br />--------<br />02/20/2011: Bottom line: I think I've settled into a two-sided routine with this oil: I use it, first, for light-frying/sauteing veggies (with yams or sweet potatoes as a basis; adding greens, like spinach, in the mix later on). I don't do this often though, 'cause I prefer to steam or eat raw, rather than fry anything; sauteing is quicker though, so when I'm pressed for time, this is workable. The other use is for skin: skin really loves this oil -- in addition to staying hydrated forever, it becomes very even in texture and colour; after shower I grease myself up, literally from head to toe, and it's just lovely (except for the clothes who get stained :-)."

Lemen,8,37,1,1312329600,Waste of my money.,"The Nutiva coconut oil was not moisturizing, which wasn't a surprise since oil doesn't moisturize, it just coats whatever you put it on. As such, once you moisturize your skin then apply coconut oil, this can help slow down the evaporation of the moisture into the air. That is great if you are less than 30 years old.  At 50+ I actually want and need moisture. I used this product faithfully for 6 weeks and all it did was smooth my legs for about an hour and then they were parched and dried looking again because I hadn't actually added moisture. My legs also felt greasy and had a faint odor of coconut. I don't really want a 2-step process of using a moisturizer on my legs then coating them with coconut oil.  As a face moisturizer it just made my face break out (yuuuuck!). As for the taste, I'll just say that butter has nothing to fear from this stuff. I really can't believe I fell for the hype and wasted my money with this purchase."

The coconut flavor is not overwhelming when cooking, and tastes like coconut (and nothing else!) by itself.  If you're going to be trying to up your healthy fat intake with coconut oil or use it to treat one of the many things coconut oil is supposed to be good for, this is by far the most palatable one I've tasted.<br /><br />My only complaint is that ordering on Amazon can be problematic in warmer months.

I enjoy the very natural smell of coconut when I first use it on the skin, but the smell dissipates shortly afterwards. Cooking with it is like cooking with canola oil - it does not impart a coconut taste to the final dish. Use oils in moderation, including coconut.

It sinks right in to the hair, and keeps it moist without making it too greasy.  It's a solid at room temperature, but it softens right in your hands, so you don't have to use any effort to get it soft.  It has a light coconut scent that is not too sweet smelling.

I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I first used it in my hair. I am an African-American female, with natural hair, and I use the coconut oil to seal in the moisture in my hair after I condition my hair in the mornings. It gave my hair a beautiful sheen, and kept it soft throughout the day, so I definitely love its hair benefits.<br /><br />Then I also used it on a patch of really dry skin that I have, right on my leg.

So two thumbs up for the skin benefits as well.<br /><br />As far as cooking goes, I'm considering using it to sautee some fish and make this coconut-lime tilapia dish I saw a recipe for.

My feet, which generally take a beating since I wear flip flops a lot, look the best the have in years (even though I'm only 21 lol). The cracks in my heels have disappeared after applying nightly (not consistent) and wearing cotton socks.<br /><br />Using tips from other customers, I also put a little of the oil in my unflavored oatmeal. It was delicious! This way I am able to get a lot of flavor without having a lot of sugar like the pre-flavored packets. I can say that this oil is great and I will definitely repurchase. The two bottles came bound together in plastic so that they would not spill on anything. Also, having two bottles allows for cosmetic use for one and food use for the other.

Works out wonderfully, although I think castor oil is more hydrating.  I've only used a few other types of coconut oil, but I find this one pleasing in taste (no weird or artificial taste) and consistency (not lumpy or grainy). It is also the most affordable one I've found.<br /><br />I use it to make popcorn (yummy) frequently, and eat a scoop or two each week unheated.  I just let it melt in my mouth.  I know about the risks of using plastic for storage, but at some point, a person has the draw the line.  My line has been drawn, and I've decided that coconut oil in plastic containers is A-OK by me.  If you have major concerns, I suppose that you could transfer it into a glass jar.

Plus, this is one of the best oils you can consume *period*.  It is so rich in HDL and other good fats it'll scrub your arteries clean in a month.

I had been using almond oil, jojoba oil, all different kinds of body lotions, and castor/olive oil. NONE came close to being as brilliant as coconut oil!<br /><br />About me:<br /><br />*I am 20 yrs old, white/half-russian. My skin is acne-prone and a BIT on the dry-side. My skin doesn't tan or burn easily, and I am obsessed with anti-aging (I want to write a book on what worked and what didn't when I am older :D). I live in California, so the weather is rather neutral year-round.<br /><br />*What coconut oil has done for me:<br /><br />Coconut oil smells sooo nice and has a great texture -- depending on the weather it is either creamy and solid or silky and liquid. Being as affordable as it is, I can smear this all-over my body after showers and it will absorb within 30 minutes to an hour. My skin feels sooo soft and hydrated afterwards and it even helps my sunless tanners last longer! This stuff made my skin so soft that one day I wore cotton shorts from Hollister (so you can imagine, slightly baggy). It was a hot day, and after walking around outside for only around 45 minutes my upper thighs/bikini line were KILLING ME. When I went home I noticed the first layer of skin had rubbed off because it was SO soft!!! This was a bit annoying, so I cut-down on the amount of coconut oil I use...but that was like *Wow*<br />Also, my boyfriend constantly tells me how soft my skin is when I am using it *waiting for three more to arrive tomorrow!*<br /><br />Coconut oil is the best moisturizer EVER! I absolutely love this stuff and will continue using it forever! I still use castor oil every few weeks just for the healing properties (I think) and for my eyes/teeth/gums, but this stuff is sooo nice for my skin (and hair in small portions)!<br /><br />If you want a moisturizer that FINALLY gives the results you want, THIS IS IT!!!

I have to agree with everyone that the plastic container is a let down, but I bought some small mason jars and put my oil in them. Works perfectly. That way I have a jar for the kitchen and one for the bath. Definitely try Nutiva if you're even a little curious about coconut oil. You won't be disappointed."

I also put some in a tiny tub to put on underneath lipstick (which can be so drying!).<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most obviously, it is delicious and healthy for cooking.  The only caveat I'll put here is that you definitely have to know ahead of time that the coconut smell is there.  There are some meals I just don't want to smell like coconut, so those I use my good old canola oil on.  But for chicken, with a little soy sauce, it is downright tropical, and I love it!

I don't worry about it spoiling because it has a much longer shelf life than other oils and a very high heat tolerance.  I use it for cooking mostly.  It is great on popcorn with sea salt, freshly baked bread, in stir frys and you can often use it in place of butter in many dishes.  I have a fabulous raw chocolate recipe that I make with it and give out as gifts.  After reading The Coconut Oil Miracle book by Bruce Fife I try to use coconut oil as much as I can.  It is anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal.  Truly a miracle food that is so healthy for you.<br /><br />I also use it on my hair when it needs a deep conditioning treatment.  Just leave it in overnight and wash out the next day and my hair is so shiny and soft afterwards and even feels a bit thicker.  It is great for your skin, especially if you feel like you are getting sick.  Just slather it on and let its amazing healing properties absorb into your blood stream via your skin.  I use it in smoothies to help my immune system as well.  And if I feel like I am coming down with something I will mix it with orange juice like is recommended in the Coconut Oil Miracle book.<br /><br />I also oil pull with it.  If you haven't read about oil pulling with coconut oil, you should.  It is a great teeth whitener among many other things including healing mouth sores.<br /><br />I really like the Nutiva brand because it tastes fresher than most. Very clean coconut flavor. I like that it is organic and doesn't have any thing funky in it nor is it processed unhealthily like so many other brands."

I have seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp, ears and near my eyebrows and I have put the coconut oil on and left it on overnight (using a towel on my pillow because it is greasy) and the difference is amazing! I was given an Rx from my dermatologist (Luxiq Mouse - which is a steroid), but I don't like the idea of putting that on daily, as it thins out your skin.<br />I've tried lotions (cetaphil, eucerine, etc.) but I have never had an improvement like this.<br /><br />In addition to the seborrheic dermatitis, I have very dry skin. At the end of the day, if I'm wearing a dark-colored shirt, upon removal, the shirt is lined with skin flakes (gross, I know). But, since using this coconut oil, the flakes are GONE! It's truly unbelievable! Prior to receiving the coconut oil, I was washing with Cerave and using their lotion as well. While I noticed my skin didn't feel as ""tight"", I still had flakes. It wasn't until I mixed the coconut oil with the Cerave that the flakes disappeared.<br /><br />I also take 1 tbsp of coconut oil daily, with my breakfast. The flavor is amazing!<br /><br />I would 100% recommend this to anyone with dry skin or seborrheic dermatitis!"

The VIRGIN coconut oil has a nice, light coconut flavor.  The EXPELLER pressed coconut oil has no flavor. So, if you a buying virgin coconut oil here's my tip: Barlean's had the best flavor and smell...I wanted to eat it right out of the jar it smelled so good, tasted phenomenal!! Barlean's was the most expensive of the three but for the flavor worth it. Nutiva was a close second in taste & smell and is more economical. Tropical Traditional (which I have always loved their products in the past) did not measure up in flavor. In fact it had a strange, burnt taste and smell...something was off about it. If you want no coconut flavor at all, get the expeller pressed coconut oil. It is less expensive than virgin coconut oil...all three companies use proper, healthy, non-chemical practices to extract the oil, so I would go with the best buy for the expeller cold pressed oil but pay a little more for the flavored version.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VLZ8D0"">Barlean's Organic Oils Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16-Ounce Jar</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64"">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VVVJ6W"">32-oz glass - Gold Label Organic Virgin Coconut Oil - 1 quart</a>"

I started with a brand I purchased a local Hy-Vee because I wanted to try it out before I bought a more substantial amount. THe first buy was a refined coconut oil made by Spectrum. It worked well for what I used it for - nightly oil cleansing on my face, moisturizer and as an addition to my weekly deep conditioner for my hair...occasionally I'd spread some on toast. It worked out well, so i purchased ther Nutiva and was expecting a much better product than the Spectrum....it arrived yesterday and I was not disappointed. As soon as I opened it I could smell it - it smells and tastes AMAZING - just like fresh coconut. If you're not a fan of coconut, remember that this is not the smell/taste of sweetened, dried coconut or coconut fragrance...it smalls like actual coconut. I did my first oil cleanse with it last night and it seems slightly gritty at times, but nothing that is concerning to me. This is definitely a staple from now on!!"

189896,B001EO5Q64,A30ZWHKMYS67CM,LazyChick,3,3,5,1303516800,Great Stuff for a Number of Things,"I was almost put off using coconut oil entirely, after purchasing another brand (I think NOW was it, but different packaging). It came hard as a rock, yellow-looking and smelled pretty foul (almost sickly-sweet) - certainly nothing like coconut. I literally was chipping it out of the jar, and melting it was near impossible. Eventually, I realized that I was dealing with rancid oil, so it's pretty fortunate that I didn't use it all that often. Yuck.<br /><br />After watching a view Youtube videos for hair care, I noticed everyone's was white, creamy and you could easily scoop it out of the jar, so I decided to give it another shot and purchased Nutiva in February 2011. I'm so glad I did, too, because this stuff is great and for a number of things, some of which caught me off guard.<br /><br />- Cooking -<br />I enjoy cooking with it now and then, especially with my quick-fix quesadillas when I don't have time to cook anything else. However, it doesn't work on everything due to the subtle yet nutty flavor it can give, but I do like it for frying. Your place will smell like coconut when you fry with it, as a warning. I do love how fast it heats up, though.<br /><br />- Hair -<br />I originally intended to use this for hair and as a deep conditioning mask. I am biracial, with 3A/3b and a tinge of 3C hair. While I usually prefer to have it relaxed, I decided to give it a break due to lack of funds. The hard water we have here has been wreaking havoc on my hair and it's been in need of a trim for a while, but this stuff has greatly improved things, and it even can be used (lightly) to help tame frizz to some degree as a leave-in. My ringlets are back and the best-looking they've been since I can remember, and all I've been using since then is just Aphogee Green Tea spray, coconut oil and occasional argan oil.<br /><br />- Skin -<br />I consistently use this on my body and at night as skin cream. For the face, you only need a tiny, tiny amount. It also helps to tame down blemishes, which is a bonus, and leaves skin glowy. Last year or the year before, I also developed what looked like flesh-colored moles, which I thought were blemishes at first, but I can't be certain. Nothing I did would get rid of them though, until I started using the oil, which I found odd, but at least it worked! All in all, my skin has dramatically improved using this, with the help of some other products, and I don't feel I have to wear foundation.<br /><br />- Pets -<br />I give 1/2 tbls. to my cats and 1 tbls. to my dog a few times a week to help maintain their coats and keep their skin nice. It seems to be doing great and they've stopped driving me mental with scratching. I also tried it in hopes of helping my dog with her seizures. While it's not a drastic improvement, they have been fewer in between, which may or may not have a connection. I just mix it in their food maybe 2-3 days a week (ask your vet about how often, especially if they have health problems), and they love it. Even my female cat, who's picky about what she'll eat licks at the oil before she munches away.<br /><br />- Warts -<br />Short of the suspicious-looking things on my face at one point, I don't get moles, warts, or even freckles. However, I did get one whopping wart on the top of my big toe last year, which nothing would get rid of. I tried apple cider vinegar, wart patches and gels - you name it; I tried it. Not only did it hurt like crazy and work slowly, but it never got rid of it. All I did get was a scar and a lot of grief, only for it to return a few weeks later.<br /><br />When I started using coconut oil on the skin, I realized one day, like with my face, that my wart that had grown back was getting smaller. I kept watching it and finally realized the connection. I started using bandaids and applied a glob of oil on the spot before bed and then really started noticing results. This wart was the size of a chick pea (sorry to be gross lol), but now you can't see anything.<br /><br />I finally looked things up and realized that it was the acid in the oil that attacks lipid-coated virus cells, such as what's associated with HPV (warts), so I guess it makes sense. I was surprised though! I can tell due to the texture of the skin that it's not 100% gone (roots), but it still getting better and I'm not embarrassed anymore. It took about a month, but the more painful options took just as long and this is pain-free. So, it's something to try!<br /><br />Love this stuff and can't stop raving about it. I'm going to purchase more soon in this size to keep one in my kitchen and one in my bathroom again, plus a larger one for the mutts. The bathroom one still has plenty in it, despite me using it near-daily."

The moisturizer I was using felt kind of scummy on my face after I added my foundation and I was having troubles with facial redness and dry patches. I was also having heat rash problems in my underarm area. I started using just a little of the coconut oil on my face in place of my moisturizer, then applying my foundation and wow! What a difference! My skin has cleared up and I love the soft smooth way my face feels. My foundation spreads and blends much better.  Also, the coconut oil really helps with the heat rash, immediately soothing the discomfort. I like using this as a hand cream too. I look forward to seeing how well it works this winter when the air is much drier.<br /><br />I have done a little cooking with it, but not enough yet to have an opinion.<br /><br />Other folks have mentioned that the oil leaked during shipment. I was concerned about this since I ordered it during the summer. I ordered 4 tubs (2 pks of 2 tubs). The plastic containers arrived packed in plastic bags, 2 tubs/bag, within the box. Even though the lids felt pretty tight on the tubs, both of the plastic bags had some coconut oil that had leaked, but not enough to feel cheated. A little oil leaked out of the plastic bags into the box, but they were the only things packed in the box so nothing was ruined. I can see that if the lids had been any looser though, there would have been a mess. Oil is hard to keep in a container with a wide mouth like this.<br /><br />One more thing...I absolutely love the smell of this stuff. It has a light roasted coconut essence which isn't too strong and doesn't linger overly long, but long enough to enjoy for a short while while it is being absorbed by the skin. Yum!"

We started giving them Greenies again and within a short period of time the build-up was gone in most areas and, overall, greatly reduced.  I realize that we could brush our dogs teeth in order to avoid the cost, but neither of us wants to take on this chore; plus, the dogs LOVE Greenies.<br /><br />I used to buy this product at Petsmart, but they're much less expensive on Amazon."

I bought these for her about two months ago when I started to be a little bothered by her breath (she's a kisser). I bought them from amazon because they were so much cheaper then at the local pet store.<br />At first, she had no interest in them. I was a little annoyed, having bought a box of 96 that was still expensive for dog treats even with the discount. She either would ignore it no matter how many times I tried reintroducing it, or take a bite then leave it. It took a few weeks and several tries, but now she loves them and eats them as soon as I give it to her. I give her at most one a day but usually one every two or three days. It hasn't upset her stomach or anything like that. The package says they aren't suitable for dogs under 6 months of age, but I stared giving them to her at about 4 months and there were no problems. She has clean, healthy teeth, but I don't think she wouldn't if I stopped giving her these. They do work in freshening her breath, however. We have a 3 year old golden retriever in the house who eats these sometimes too and has loved them since the day they came- I guess it just depends on the dog. Even though they're not the correct size for him, he's never choked and I don't think it's a problem to buy the smaller size for a larger dog.

I have German Shepards, Dobermans and medium sized hound dogs.  They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a ""garbage belly"" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the ""green"" in Greenie Bones.  I would like to know where ""E. Antic"" gets his/her information from.....as I can find nothing that says they are ""deadly"", except for those people that haven't done responsible research (not just hearsay from some list).  If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.  Do we need to bring up ""NYLABONES""?????  Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats.  Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E. Antic's post.  You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box.  I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay.  My girls live for their morning GB's and I now give them Greenie ""Smart Biscuits"" for an afternoon snack.  They love the taste and we love them for the 'benefits'!!<br /><br />I respectfully request that Amazon and Amazon members make up their own minds, and not fall to the 'fear mongers' and ignorance amoung us.

She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.

However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them."

She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids.

I gave one to my dachshund, a short-haired 25-lb ball of energy, and he loved it.  He's 10 years old and had typical dog breath.  I'm hoping that giving these to him will not only make his breath less stinky, but also (and more importantly) help out with his teeth.  Whenever he yawns or opens his mouth wide, I can see some plaque on his rear teeth.  The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up, but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure, some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age, but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.  I'll update this according to the schedule I laid out at the very top and let you know what happens.  I've also seen lots of reviews online (not about this product, but about dog- and pet-food in general) being made out of sub par or even unhealthy materials.  I'll let you know if my dog's behavior or overall health changes as well.<br /><br />One Week<br />-------<br />My dog is still loving these things.  I feed him in the morning so I like to think these are an evening snack for him.  I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from, but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a ""U"" and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less ""heavy"".  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either, other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me, because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work, though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.  They aren't damaging to my dog's health... but to say they were helpful in improving his dental situation would be giving these too much credit.<br />My S&S shipments have been cancelled and I'm out looking for a better product."

Most things that are supposedly flavored to please dogs do not please her. She just won't eat them, but Greenies for teeth...she can't wait to have them. I just ask her if she wants to brush her teeth, and she is ready and waiting. The other night I got out her pills to give her for arthritis and made the mistake of getting out the greenie at the same time.

Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs.

After trying to fix the jaw with a metal plate and it getting infected, we ended up having her lower left jaw along with all of her teeth on that sound of her mouth removed completely.  A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts ""dancing"" on her two back legs.  The last time I took her into the vet, they said she only had Grade 1 Dental Disease as opposed to the Grade 3 the year before -  Thank you Greenies for creating a delicious product that is helping to save my dog's few precious teeth!

The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing ""digestive upset"" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case."

My pup eats these treats pretty slowly (as I think she realizes it lasts longer that way), and I make sure I'm in the room while she's eating it. She'll chew off small pieces to eat, not large ones so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but I assume it would.<br /><br />I also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards, to wash it down.

I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie ""yelling"" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.  I allow her to have two Greenies per day and she seems to know that's her quota.  Both Spunky and I are very happy with Greenies and will continue to buy them!"

Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, ""Almost three."" And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. ""No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.""<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them.

I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out."

I removed other items from their diet to be sure and it did it again, instantly.

Use your own methods of making a control group, but be sure to see they have proper bowel movements and are not vomiting after you feed them the product.

Then I found:<br /><br />""At least 13 dogs have died after being fed the top-selling pet treat in the country, owners and veterinarians have told CNN. The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.""<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. ""Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog,"" the directions say.<br /><br />Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.  ""These things tend to be wolfed down,"" said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver. ""They are meant to be chewed carefully, but that's like giving a sharp knife to your 2-year-old. Dogs can't be controlled that way.""

As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.  This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them."

It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: ""a Greenie got stocked in his intestine"".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog."

The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies."

In particular, ones about dogs vomitting green sponges after eating them.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I have a little maltese (Dexter). He's a little over two years old and loves greenies. Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them."

She freaks out when she knows she's going to get one and will heard whomever is getting it right to the place we store them.  She knows if we talk about them so we have to call them G's to each other.  She will tolerate other treats if I'm waiting for an order from Amazon, but she doesn't like it.

Most of it seems to be digestible, but she threw up green foam on the morning after the second day in a row of eating one-a-day greenies. Note that she was also constipated as well. Greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these, so I am guess they know these side effects can occur. My dog has plenty of water available, but she didn't drink any more than normal, which may have resulted in the effects. I don't plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these. Giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects, and that what I plan on doing.<br />Not a complaint to me, but I think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from ""green.""

I bought them from amazon because they were so much cheaper then at the local pet store.<br />At first, she had no interest in them. I was a little annoyed, having bought a box of 96 that was still expensive for dog treats even with the discount. She either would ignore it no matter how many times I tried reintroducing it, or take a bite then leave it. It took a few weeks and several tries, but now she loves them and eats them as soon as I give it to her. I give her at most one a day but usually one every two or three days. It hasn't upset her stomach or anything like that. The package says they aren't suitable for dogs under 6 months of age, but I stared giving them to her at about 4 months and there were no problems. She has clean, healthy teeth, but I don't think she wouldn't if I stopped giving her these. They do work in freshening her breath, however. We have a 3 year old golden retriever in the house who eats these sometimes too and has loved them since the day they came- I guess it just depends on the dog. Even though they're not the correct size for him, he's never choked and I don't think it's a problem to buy the smaller size for a larger dog. I'd definitely recommend these if you want your dog's breath freshened!"

They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a ""garbage belly"" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the ""green"" in Greenie Bones.  I would like to know where ""E.

If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.  Do we need to bring up ""NYLABONES""?????  Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats.  Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E.

She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them."

However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them."

She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up."

We were given a couple of the Large ones from a friend to try.  Through carelessness on our part, our dog destroyed both large treats within 15 minutes.  When we found her, we were scared figuring she would die from swallowing this large plasticky looking treat.  We quickly did some web searches & found out that the newer formula is supposed to dissolve rather easily with water.  After making sure she drank a good amount of water, we monitored her activity.  In the end, she had no problems & we were able to find a treat that is more chewable than your biscuit type treats, but safer than rawhide (at least for her).

The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up, but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure, some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age, but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.

I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from, but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a ""U"" and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less ""heavy"".  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either, other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me, because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work, though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.  They aren't damaging to my dog's health... but to say they were helpful in improving his dental situation would be giving these too much credit.<br />My S&S shipments have been cancelled and I'm out looking for a better product."

So I started using Greenies, and wow...they have her scheduled for a teeth cleaning that I will cancel, because it has kept her teeth so clean. Best of all, though, she is a very picky eater. Most things that are supposedly flavored to please dogs do not please her. She just won't eat them, but Greenies for teeth...she can't wait to have them. I just ask her if she wants to brush her teeth, and she is ready and waiting. The other night I got out her pills to give her for arthritis and made the mistake of getting out the greenie at the same time. She didn't want the pills although they were covered in peanut butter, which she usually loves. Once she finished the greenie, she wanted the ""peanut butter pills."""

Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs.

She had been rescued from a puppy mill and was underweight, coated in fleas and had a broken jaw.  After trying to fix the jaw with a metal plate and it getting infected, we ended up having her lower left jaw along with all of her teeth on that sound of her mouth removed completely.  A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts ""dancing"" on her two back legs.  The last time I took her into the vet, they said she only had Grade 1 Dental Disease as opposed to the Grade 3 the year before -  Thank you Greenies for creating a delicious product that is helping to save my dog's few precious teeth!

The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing ""digestive upset"" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case."

My pup eats these treats pretty slowly (as I think she realizes it lasts longer that way), and I make sure I'm in the room while she's eating it. She'll chew off small pieces to eat, not large ones so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but I assume it would.<br /><br />I also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards, to wash it down.

They are very expensive (usually $32.99, but marked down to $29.99 sometimes). Then, on top of that you have state tax. So ... if I buy 4 boxes: two Petite and two Teenies in a store that has ""Pet"" as part of the name, it'll cost me over $135.00. If I do the same thing through Amazon companies prices it costs me about $85.00. That's a difference of $50.00 (for the Math impaired reader ...). Go with free shipping because it, literally, gets here the same time frame. Use the $50.00 and take your spouse out to dinner!<br />The product is great. I did notice that two in the same day was a bit tough on my Pomeranian's digestive system and caused a little diarrhea. The dogs love the taste and would eat them all the time. We get the small ones despite having two larger dogs because they will chomp them down in a heartbeat.

Had to buy a tub of Greenies regular and surely enough, he sniffed at it, did his dance, grabbed it and ran away (well, he was so happy he skipped away) with it.  When I smell it, the regular definitely smells better/more appetizing whereas the LITE has the blah~ smell to it.

I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!

Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, ""Almost three."" And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. ""No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.""<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them. Her breath is fresh, her teeth are white and tartar free, and she's a very happy dog."

I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out."

We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him, never made him sick, and made his breath smell good. I would only give him one Greenies a day and to spread that one Greenie out over the entire day, I would take pliers and cut it into 6-8 little pieces. Seemed like my dog would feel more fulfilled to have little pieces throughout the day versus one whole Greenie once a day.

Use your own methods of making a control group, but be sure to see they have proper bowel movements and are not vomiting after you feed them the product.  Secondly, Greenies.com(the Nutro Company) will not honor purchases made through unauthorized vendors.  Amazon directly is an ""authorized vendor"".

In 13 of those cases, the pet died.""<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding.

I thought that it would be a nice and neat way to store them.  Instead what I recieved was a bubble bag full of individually wrapped greenies.  Not neat and easily stored at all.  The picture of this item shows a box, but I did not recieve a box of greenies.  I wish I would have just ordered the bag of greenies, with the ziploc top, at least that is easily stored.  My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one.  My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog.  My main complain about this purchase was that I didn't recieve the box of greenies that is described.

As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.  This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them."

It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: ""a Greenie got stocked in his intestine"".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog."

The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies."

He also had diarrhea on a regular basis.Within a week of feeding him these on a regular basis he would stay in the squatting poop position for about three to five minutes every time he pooped trying to get more out.

We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them.

I was giving these to my dog for a few days, her breath was great and I felt good that her teeth were also being cleaned aside from brushing. I noticed she was getting diarrhea didnt really think it was the greenies until I did research and found alot of dogs have digestive issues over this stuff and some small dogs have even died. My dog is 60lbs not small but it was affecting her stomach. I stopped for a week and her stool was back to normal. The other day I gave her one greenie to see how she would react and 12hrs later the diarrhea is back.

I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle.

A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored,"The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of ""there must be something better"".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per ""serving""), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word ""puff"" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed ""all natural"". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them."

I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of ""regular"" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor."

I actually wrote to Pringles once and asked if they had any plans to make a reduced fat salt and vinegar chip...to my disappointment, they said no. For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange. I have tried a couple baked salt and vinegar chips from small brands and they were all disgusting in flavor and texture. This is the only way to go that I have found so far.

Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying ""chip"" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers.

They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation ""spices"" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"

I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.

The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.

We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.

These chips weigh about half what a bag of good chips cost, for the same money.

The sweet potato completely takes away any blandness or boringness and adds good taste.  And there is just a touch of salt - just enough to bring out the YUM without overdoing it.<br /><br />Finally, the package size.  When I saw ""0.8 ounce"", I expected that I would want two, three, or even four bags of these at a time.  Nope - one bag is a good snack!

That is a fair description as the lime does heighten the taste buds and enhances the slight heat from the chili.<br /><br />My family really enjoys this flavor and it is among our favorites. We have tried most of the other varieties of Popchips and have our own preferences. My older daughter likes salt and pepper, barbecue, and this flavor the best. I like barbecue, sour cream and onion, and this flavor the best. My wife likes salt and vinegar and this flavor the best. My younger daughter does not like this flavor. She prefers barbecue, cheese, and sour cream and onion. Our least favorite is the original, probably because it is so plain by comparison.<br /><br />To me, Popchips are sort of a cross of potato chips, popcorn, and rice cakes. They are potato, but popped like popcorn and sort of puffy like rice cakes. They definitely have more flavor than many rice cakes and are a nice alternative to popcorn.

I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety."

They are ok but not as good as a fried chip.  Maybe eating these will discourage me from chips period.  Like some other people making comments, I'll probably finish the box and not buy again.

But I also have high blood pressure so a lot of snacks that I use as a treat are too high-sodium for me. I eat rice cakes with peanut butter or cottage cheese once in a while and I happened to see Popchips on Amazon.com. These <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVAWY0"">Popchips Original Potato Chips, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a> were advertised at a special price and all the flavored ones were sold out, so I decided to try the original flavor. After trying my first bag I have a few comments.<br />1. Great service - I ordered them on 1/27, and they were delivered on 2/3, with no damage to the packaging.<br />2. I like the 24-pack that are individual servings because that helps me regulate portion control.<br />3. As a previous reviewer noted they do taste somewhat like Pringles - whether that's good or bad is up to individual tastes.<br />4. The nutritional information isn't terrible: a serving has 100 calories, 3 grams of fat with no cholesterol or saturated/trans fat, and only 160 mg.sodium; Pringles also contains 160 mg of sodium but has 150 calories and 9 grams of fat, as compared to potato chips with an average of 150 calories, 180 mg. sodium, and 10 grams fat, and pretzels with 110 calories, 450 mg sodium, and 1 gram fat.<br />5. They are kind of dry and bland, but are delicious with salsa - I really liked them with Costco's peach mango salsa! I don't have cottage cheese in the house so I couldn't try that. And I think peanut butter wouldn't be good unless something ""wet"" like sugar-free jam or jelly is also added.<br />I just got them so I'm not sure if I'll reorder another box; I think I'm going to next order Amazon's 6-flavor variety pack (4 Original Potato, 4 BBQ, 4 Salt & Pepper, 4 Sea Salt & Vinegar, 4 Sour Cream & Onion, 4 Cheddar)before deciding. I would give them 3 stars if my review was just based on taste; I'm giving 4 stars because I really want to like them because they're more healthy and I can think of lots of healthy foods to use them with - why not tuna,, egg salad, etc?"

DH had a heart attack last September and, after getting two stents put in, has had to cut out all of his beloved snacks, largely due to the high fat content and sodium (especially the sodium). I've been looking for something ""snacky"" with reduced sodium that isn't awful, and these are just the ticket. One .8 ounce bag, one serving, is a nice round 100 calories with only 3g of fat (.5g polyunsaturated, 2g monounsaturated), no cholesterol, 16g carbs, and 95mg of sodium. They have a bit of a salty taste, and they aren't very sweet with only 2g of sugar. I think they'd make an interesting dip chip with a plain-yogurt-based dip.<br /><br />I liked these Popchips so much that I got the next lowest sodium kind, the Chili Lime Potato flavor with 170mg of sodium and everything else the same except 1g of fiber. DH can have no more than 1500mg of sodium per day, but considering I'm using mostly frozen vegetables and not adding any salt to anything, I think he can have a bag of these on occasion without worry. And yowie zowie! What a big burst of flavor! The Chili Lime Potato Popchips are definitely the go-to chip when you've got to have something that tastes really ""bad for you.""<br /><br />I expect we're going to be signing up to get our Popchips delivered regularly via Amazon subscription. If we had been eating these Popchips instead of the regular high-fat/high-sodium/high-carb fare all along, I expect we'd both be a lot healthier now. A highly recommended product."

The popchips give a nice satisfying crunch, and I would not have know they weren't fried. They have the nice mouth-feel of a fried chip, they don't taste baked or rice cracker-ish. The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack."

I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips."

So, when I got the opportunity to review them, I was so excited to try them out. Unfortunately they did not live up to any expectations that I had from the good things I heard about them. The bags are hard to open but once you finally open them, of course the bag is less than half full. In my case that was a good thing. The texture is strange and light but I could get used to that. The chili lime ""flavor"" is terrible! Mostly what I taste is lime and salt. I like lime, but not that much. The so called ""chili"" flavor is almost non-existent and not enjoyable. It doesn't add anything in my opinion. Despite my experience these chips have good reviews. That tells me that I just need to try other flavors. This one needs improvement."

This was my first time trying Popchips, and I loved eating them, the texture is great.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the size of the bags. It's like they are only half-filled, or the bags are twice the size they need to be. It makes it look like there is more in the bag than there is.<br /><br />Note that although these are '100 calorie' bags, each bag has 16 carbs.

Popchips (any variety) are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips, but that seems like a plus to me.  They have a nicer consistency than potato chips.  I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.

Definitely has a sweet potato flavor, so if you don't like that vegetable, you probably won't like the flavor of these.  One bag (0.8 oz or 23 g) contains 19 chips, has 100 calories, 3 g of fat, 95 mg of sodium, and 45 mg of potassium.  That isn't bad compared to many other snack foods.  For example, a comparable size bag of regular potato chips would have about 130 calories and 8 g of fat.  However, these Popchips don't taste like regular potato chips.  If you like the fatty, salty flavor of regular potato chips but are trying to cut back, I would recommend a reduced fat kettle chip variety instead.<br /><br />After reviewing the ingredients of these ""natural"" Popchips, they are not as healthy as I expected.  The first two ingredients are rice flour and sweet potato FLAKES.  The remaining ingredients are tapioca starch, sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil, organic yellow corn flour, seasoning (sea salt, dried cane syrup, maltodextrin, sweet potato powder, natural flavor, citric acid), sugar, and annatto (natural color).  They contain no fiber nor vitamin A, which I would expect to find in a sweet potato product.<br /><br />All in all, the Sweet Potato Popchips are not a bad snack to munch on when compared to many other processed snacks foods.

I don't crave cheetos anymore which I was addicted to.  I know eat a bag of these and my craving is gone. They are actually healthy and for only 100 calories a bag and around 3 grams of fat - it is a much better choice than cheetos. They are very crunchy and full of flavor. I am ordering these again.

I love the crunch almost as much as I love the calorie content and the single serve bags! Because they are not fried you are saving fat and calories but they are not flat and tasteless like the baked chips either. You know the ones that if you bite off a piece the wrong way you can pierce your tongue with it? Never again! The BBQ is a tad strong IMHO but they are still keepers! The original flavor is awesome.
359503,B007M832YY,A3KZ7OH4VRL048,Jonathan,2,2,3,1327622400,"A healthy alternative, but with overpowering and inconsistent flavor","These are definitely a healthier alternative than your standard potato chip - each bag (roughly 20 silver dollar-sized chips) has only three grams of fat and 100 calories. They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are ""popped"" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag."

The flavor does NOT disappoint - tangy, spicy, and a dash of sweet. This is my new favorite ""chip""! Now, if you've never tried Popchips before, just be aware that the texture is different than regular potato chips, somewhere between a traditional chip and a rice cake. It can throw off die-hard potato chip fans, but if you just want something crunchy and awesome tasting, without as many calories and fat, then this is going to be your new favorite snack!"

They taste great, have a quirky crunch and are low cal/fat (in relation to traditional chips).<br /><br />Sadly though I must base this review on the Chili Lime flavor I was sent through the Amazon Vine program. These are probably my least favorite flavor to date. They have the lime twang you would expect and a little chili heat (though not overly spicy) and even the potato flavor comes through. Individually these all work but somehow in this chip they really don't. Interestingly enough the aftertaste is actually better than the intial flavor of the chip itself.<br />I'm not saying this flavor is bad, it's just not that good.<br /><br />Overall, great brand with great flavors in general but Chili Lime doesn't stack up against the others."

I used to live in the UK and remember eating those delicious salt and vinegar chips. Flavor-wise these aren't as tart and vinegary as those, but they have a really nice twang to them that's not overwhelming, with some sweet/salty/savory overtones. Texture-wise these are light and airy. They are about 1/8 inch thick, like a mini rice cake though not as dense. They are great for dipping or eating all by themselves. The bag has just the right serving size. You don't feel too full afterward but they are definitely filling.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is because even though they are natural, they aren't organic, and most non-organic potatoes are GMO (genetically modified), so maybe not totally healthy, but definitely delicious!"

They are the right mix of sweet and salty so all those cravings get satisfied in one bite.  They are light and crispy.  If you have ever had a Muncho chip, they are similar in texture to those but not so salty like a Muncho.  You really don't get a strong sweet potato flavor and I at two small bags in one setting with ease.  They are low fat, low calorie (100 calories per bag which is a serving).  They contain natural ingredients like sunflower and safflower oil, sea salt, and organic yellow corn flour.  They are very very good."

I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs. unhealthy comparison always came up negative.  With the introduction of Kettle Chips brand and widespread availibity of them and Route 11, and competition from the big manfacturers, the chip bar has been raised.  However, they haven't gotten any healthier, so I try to keep them still as a ""sometimes"" snack.<br /><br />I'd seen Popchips in the store, and had wondered if they were any good, but never made the plunge.  Amazon was offering them at a discount price, and with the other reviews adding to my curiosity, I went for it...and was happy with the results.<br /><br />Popchips have a different texture than traditional potato chips.  They are a bit fluffier with more thickness.  I'd put the texture somewhere between Munchos and a mini-rice cake.  However, they still have a satisfying potato chip crunch and potato flavor.  I am typically a salt & vinegar chip fan, but in the case of Popchips, the BBQ is the real standout.  The BBQ flavor is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, with just a little bit of tanginess.  Every friend who we've introduced to them has been pleasantly surprised and gone off to buy their own.<br /><br />If the health factor wasn't part of the equation - would I choose Popchips over Kettle Brand?  For most varieties, its probably a no - potato chips still have a great crunch that's hard to give up.  But for BBQ, I think that Popchips has it nailed - their flavor is better than any other BBQ chip I've had, so they come out on top.  And at considerably less calories and fat - it's a no brainer."

My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar.

When you open your first bag and put a popchip in your mouth and start eating it, it has a very different texture than you would expect, At-least for me, I did not know what to expect for the texture, and the first few I ate I was I was not sure if I would like it, but then the flavors started to do a happy dance in my mouth, and I got use to the texture and now I cannot get enough of these. They are very addictive, like a legal drug.. They are filling, low in calories and fat. They are my new favorite chips.<br /><br />I recommend going to the website and sending the company an email to let them know what you think of the chips. They are excited to hear what you think and may send you some coupons just for emailing them.<br /><br />If you have never tried these, do it, they are worth it. This variety pack is worth it, good price, great chips. I am eating a bag of bbq while I write this and have a bag of plain popchips waiting for me later. For a chip like this, I didn't have high expectations for the plain chips. Some low fat chips and foods that don't have seasoning taste bland and not work it, not these, even the plain chips have great flavor."

They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.

They are really crisp. The flavor is a little bland, but it also doesn't have the aftertaste that some vegetable chips can have.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the chips is rice flour, not sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I'd like these better if they had more going for them nutritionally. The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber, vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon.

When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these ""chips"" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's ""good"" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again."

The biggest problem for me would be if I bought the large bag I would be too tempted to eat way more than a serving.  So these single sized bags are ideal.<br /><br />Also should mention that the sweet potato variety that I tried do not contain any dairy which is a necessity for me and I'm sure others have similar issues."

So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth."

So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those ""truth in advertising"" points that annoys me so I mention it."

First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.

Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're ""probably"" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a ""tomato"" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like ""Tomato and Basil"" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.

I don't want to soften/melt it each time I need a teaspoonful, so I struggle a bit and scoop it out.<br /><br />  On toast or English muffins, you can use it just like butter, but it seems to have a much more pleasant taste, and leaves the bread more crispy, {never soggy like butter can sometimes pool on toast in little patches.} To use making scrambled eggs or an omelet, it's easy to use, just like any oil, and adds no real discernible taste to me.

The ""Extra Virgin"" label is just for marketing purpose and to make the product itself more appealing to buyer.<br />I have no way to verify if this coconut oil is truly organic or cold pressed, since I wasn't in Philippine at the time they made it, but<br />I hope they are honest.<br /><br />Anyway,<br />I like the taste of this oil, I mix it with peanut butter, and I wish if I can find a coconut oil with a stronger coconut taste. For me the coconut taste is not strong enough. I tried different brand from amazon, and all has the same taste. I tried the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E1MI"">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 29-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)</a> and has the same taste as this one, except this Nature's oil brand is sometime cheaper<br />I like it, and will keep doing so as long as they offer it at a competitive price."

It does wonderful things for my hair, and skin (conditions, moisturizes it without any buildup). I'm in the process of transiting from my chemically treated hair and was informed that pure coconut oil is great for natural hair, and wow I am impressed. It's a very light oil, unlike olive oil, which is great, but thicker and heavier.  I haven't used it in my food yet.  Also there is not a coconut scent to it, and it does not really have a taste to it."

The first thing I did was try it on my hair. I can't remember if I left a review on the other Coconut oil I bought but I have hair past my waist and I was in my pool on a hot day and when I finally got out I was exhausted.  I wanted to rest before I showered and passed out. I went to sleep with all of that chlorine in my hair and my hair was a dull, brittle feeling. I had just received the oil 2 days before. So I rubbed it through my hair. My hair seemed to be bright and soft. It even looked a little more blond. I have been cutting up veggies and spraying the oil on them while cooking. I bought the ""Misto"" and filled it with the Coconut oil. But the best thing so far...Is toast with the oil on it. There are so many benefits of the Oil and it is delicious.<br />***Here is the EDIT***9-5-12<br />I found a new delicious way to use this. You know the Olive oil bread dipping with garlic? Well, I made spaghetti and I put my seasonings and started to put my olive oil in my round dishes and right then I stopped. I put 2 tbsp of EVOO and 3 tbsp of Coconut oil the grated the garlic and added my Parmesan cheese. OMG, it was so wonderful.<br />Thanks to all of you who inspired me to start using this stuff."

I've tried numerous products on her to try to remove the little bumps, but nothing had worked. Almost immediately after applying a very thin layer of coconut oil on her skin, there was an amazing improvement! The bumps lessened, and after a week they had completely disappeared! After seeing these results, I had my son use it, who has eczema on his hands.... and again, the eczema cleared up almost immediately.<br /><br />I personally use the coconut oil on my hands to moisturize them, and also put a tablespoon of the stuff in my coffee every morning to help with my metabolism as I have thyroid issues."

I use this brand on my daughter's skin from around 5mths to now 11mths. She had severe Ezcema and it kept recuring whenever she got hot. her skin in exactly like a baby's skin should be - soft and smooth since I started using it. Plus I'm always smelling her bc she smells so yummy. OFF TOPIC: I also give her lots of pure coconut water and she loves it<br />For me, I spread it on my toast, sprinkle on my salads, saute with it - scrambled eggs are THE BEST when fried with this. I even put a few teaspoons in my hot choclate (yummy). It's the best for retaining moisture in your hair so I also use as a hot oil treatment before bed and wash off next day. I let my hair air dry and it's the softest its been in years. I lather with is right after my shower and wake up with soft supple skin. I keep one in the bathroom, another in the Kitchen and one in my daughter's room. I will NEVER be without this super product.<br />Oh and my mom swears by it too as it's helped control her blood sugar (she's a diabetic) Her Doc is so impressed he took her off Metformin."

I was hesitate at first after seeing a friend use it on his hair (He's Spanish so it works with different hair types)I thought his hair took well to the product because of the completely different texture, but I tried it anyway.<br /><br />I must say my hair absolutely loves this stuff. It not only moisturizer my hair but it makes it really soft and manageable. It also gives my hair shine, body, and luster. Although, I have flakes here and there the amount of dandruff has decreased dramatically, when I use the product consistently.I have even given it a test run by allowing my hair to go without it for about a week. I only used regular conditioner on my hair. The results were terrible. My hair became dried and rough. It lost the luster and shine and it was no longer silky to the touch.<br /><br />This product is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone with any hair type."

There are so many different types if fat, they should not all be lumped together.  Avoid the long chain saturated fats (animal fats), but short chain saturated fats (like butter, palm, and coconut) are fine.<br /><br />I love cooking my morning eggs in this oil.  They stick WAY less than cooked in butter or olive oil.  Yes, it imparts a VERY MILD coconut taste to whatever you cook in it.  I don't mind, and have come to like it.  It was different the first few times, tho.  I also recommend you get an aluminum anodized (ceramic non-stick) pan.  Yes, I know they still contain teflon...doesn't bother me (the anodize coating is porous, and the pores are filled with teflon).

Makes for a nice change from olive oil and it has a lovely flavor and scent.  I also use it on my lips when a I need a quick moisturizer.  This product does change very quickly from solid to liquid when it is warmed.  That is great for cooking, but when using it as a spread, it can be messy.  The fridge can make it too hard and leaving it on the counter in the summer will turn it to oil. I have not found the happy medium yet, but I like the product so I will continue to use it."

After I shave my legs and I put this stuff on it helps my legs stay so smooth and soft. My hair does not grow back so prickly. I also love how when I go into the ocean after I shave my legs it does not burn anymore! I also use this for baking food. My food comes out more moist, especially cakes.

I'm transitioning from using over the counter products with more natural alternatives and I truly am pleased. After about a month of using it as an overnight prepoo and after wash sealer I have noticed a change for the better in my hair. Coconut oil is the only oil that can penetrate into your hair follicles. My hair holds moisture a lot better than ever before, is stronger, shinier, smoother and softer. It makes a great hot oil treatment in tandem with amla oil. The smell isn't strong - it has a light nutty coco butter scent.<br /><br />Also, I found using this with shea butter liquifies it easier when rubbing your palms together. I've only used this product on my hair but I would love to try it with cooking."

This oil is easy to scoop out and it melts in your hands so doesn't need to be continually microwaved. I ran out of anti-wrinkle cream, so I decided to put this oil of my face instead, and it makes it very soft and supple and hopefully it will keep the wrinkles at bay as well. On a whim, I decided to use some while frying rice and it came out absolutely delicious. It gives a hint of coconut flavor to dishes cooked in it. I'm ordering another jar because I don't want to cook with something I'm scooping out to use on my face and hair.  I will be ordering many more jars."

I use it for my baby's ezema now too, its greasy on the skin but soaks in quickly.  When cooking I use it in place of butter and olive oil and it has actually helped with my weight loss and my husbands, of course you have to eat healthy too but it made a noticeable difference in a two week period of time."

It is still sitting in the cupboard with only one use. Later, I read an article and found that to get the benefits of coconut oil you need it unrefined. When I opened the lid the smell of coconut assured me that this oil was the real thing--I love this stuff! I've used it so many different ways; my favourite ways to use are as a sugar scrub or as a deodorant--melt a few tablespoons of oil, put in 1/8 cup baking soda and cornstarch, and a couple drops of tea tree oil."

Antibiotics, skin creams, food changes, special shampoos, ugh you name it, I've put more money onto my dogs rear end then I have ever spent on myself, and to top it off all his skin issues make him smelly! I read online that coconut oil helps solve a multitude of issues inside and out, and since it's something all natural, I feel better about using it in general.<br /><br />I put it directly onto his legs and lower back just today, the fragrant coconut oil really helps with cutting back on how smelly he is, He seems less restless with his itchy spots - but only time will really tell if this stuff is really going to make any progress for him.<br /><br />The other reason I purchased this was because I wanted to make my own handmade soap, and it worked just fine for that use!"

It is the best moisturizer for my face and hair (I have tried almond, shea and grapeseed too), and not to mention, it feels so smooth, creamy and totally awesome on my hands, fingertips and feet.  Also, this is totally natural and cold pressed.  What more can you ask for?  No bad odors either (unlike shea oil)!  I have used the Nutiva organic coconut oil too, and Nature Way just feels a lot better and totally awesome on my hands.  I cannot comment as far as cooking is concerned, because I go through these jars very fast just using them for hair and skincare and scalp message.  I use this and pure almond oil alternatively on my eyelids and under eyes.  Try it by all means, if you are thinking about it."

I wasn't sure what I'd gotten myself into when I first tried a spoonful.  The texture reminded me a bit of crisco (uh!), but it immediately started to warm on my tongue and there was a heavenly, light coconut aftertaste that reminded me a bit of an almond joy bar (without the almond or chocolate).  I prefer not to eat it by the spoonful because of the consistency, but really like spreading it on a graham cracker, the taste of which reminds me of coconut cream pie with a graham cracker crust. I also like cooking with it, and didn't notice coconut-tasting chicken. I recently ordered a larger amount of coconut oil and tried a different brand, but I prefer the Nature's Way flavor. I'll use the other brand as a moisturizing cream, and order more of the Nature's Way for eating and cooking. It's wonderful for moisturizing after a shower, or for using right before bed when the coconut scent is restful. This is my favorite brand, and I'm sticking to it."

The coconut oil is in a crisco consistency, but when I bake something with it, I just smear it on the pan, and when I fry something with it, I just drop it in the pan like I would butter. It smells incredible! After cooking with it, I could smell it on me for a few hours after and loved it. I use lots of it when I make coconut chicken, shrimp, etc. I use it to sautee my vegetables too. The coconut taste is not overwhelming, so substituting this healthy option for your regular cooking oil will not ""ruin"" your dishes or significantly change the taste of your food. I will purchase again."

Normally I have really dry skin on my nose at forehead to the extent that it would start peeling off in the middle of the day... and no lotions would work! :( Coconut oil is the only thing that keeps my skin fairly normal in this regard -- especially with the dry, harsh winters of IL.

About a month ago I stumbled upon an article of someone claiming coconut oil cleared up her keratosis, I was skeptical but figured it was worth a shot. I have been applying coconut oil to my skin every time I take a shower and also mixing in about 1/2 a tablespoon with my dinner for about a month now.  I also added a daily multivitamin into my diet. The progress was slow but now all of a sudden my skin has shown incredible improvement. I would say my keratosis has cleared up as much as 75%!  I am shocked and very happy.

I add this to my baked banana bread and it's great.  I've used it on my hair also, I remember using pure coconut oil when I was a little girl in my home country as a conditioner and hair softener.  This is a good price as I've seen it for a lot more in our local stores."
367580,B003B3OOPA,A1UOCDH5CPYQ75,ManangK,5,6,5,1327104000,Excellent,"I am from the Philippines, so I am familiar with the smell of fresh coconut oil. I have tried various so-called virgin coconut oils before, but they smelled so rancid within one week of opening, that at one point I resorted to rendering my own coconut oil, but that was so time-consuming and tedious. Some other brands were masked by additional scent. For a while I was discouraged from trying any coconut oil, until I read reviews on this one. I tried one, and I was hooked. It smelled so HEAVENLY like the fresh coconut that I remember. Every time I would apply on my skin or hair, I would be reminded of our rice-based coconut desserts, so for purposes of having a dose of 1-2 tbsp per day, it was also not hard for me to take it plain, although the lack of sweetness quickly brings me back to the reality that it was not coconut-y dessert I was eating, but that's easily solved by adding muscovado or brown sugar. This is certainly the best coconut oil I have had so far, and the ONLY one I have tried and actually finished (I used to stop using those previous ones when I could no longer stomach the rancid smell, which usually brought the content down to only 25%).  This is also the first coconut oil brand that I actually tried to bake with (although it quickly used up my tub). I have subscribed for this to be delivered monthly, but I might change that to a more frequent supply of fresh tubs. After I was truly impressed by it, only then did I check out where it came from, and was surprised to find that it came from my country! Keep up the good work of making available a quality product to the whole world!"
367581,B003B3OOPA,A3CY0KMJVYPQMU,Oracle,2,2,3,1349481600,A few probelms,"Coconut oil is very temperature-sensitive. If the room is even slightly warm, it liquifies until it looks like water. In the fridge, it turns rock-hard. I am frequently moving it hither and thither to keep it at the consistency I like.<br /><br />The last two shipments I received were incorrectly packaged. Since it was summer and quite hot, the coconut oil arrived in its water-like state. Whoever packed them put them on their sides and consequently, several of them which were also not adequately sealed, leaked and soaked the box they came in. Amazon replaced the 3 leaky ones. Unfortunately, the same guy must have packaged them. He (she) put them in upside down. All 3 leaked.<br /><br />On the brighter side, I bought it because a doctor on line said it help cure her husband of Alzheimer's. I've been giving it to my husband who suffers from a different type of dementia. It hasn't cured him but his decline seems to have slowed and he likes the taste of it.<br /><br />Another plus is that the price at Amazon is about half of what I have seen at stores and it has many other uses."

My skin became noticeably itchy and scaly after using only coconut oil as a sole moisturizer for a month.  As soon as I ceased and switched to lotion, my skin became rehydrated.  It also clogged the pores on my face.  I got a couple of pimples on my cheeks where I have never had pimples before.  I'm not sure why it has not worked as well for me as others.  I have ceased using it as a skin moisturizer but will continue to apply it to my hair a few hours before I shampoo and condition my hair, hair is noticeably softer and more manageable with this product."

It tastes like coconut! I only take a teaspoon a day so I can warm up to it. After about 3 weeks I should be taking a tablespoon or 2. The price is right on this oil.<br /><br />Shake: Amazing Meal Pomegranate-Mango Superfood Powder, frozen strawberries, frozen cranberries, frozen raspberries, half a banana, almond milk, Greek yogurt, Big Train Strawberry Smoothie Mix and Nature's Way coconut oil. This is a thick, thick shake that will fill you up for hours.<br /><br />Update 10/08/12: I have found by far the most efficient and delicious way to get my daily 1 tablespoon. Take 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and heat until it's clear and oily in a dish. Mix in 1 heaping tablespoon of peanut butter. Stir until the peanut butter is evenly mixed into the oil. Eat on whatever. I have found that if I put large amounts on each bite, it is good sized or a bagel. The coconut oil mellows out the flavor and stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth quality of the peanut butter, so I can eat much more on a bite than if it was just peanut butter. Delicious protein and good fats."

I take it also just as it is when I am feeling lazy and don't feel like eating. After a 4 day juice fast, I started a vegetarian diet, with next to no meat (I currently don't eat meat or eggs, or any dairy products), HIGH plant fats, probably a couple pounds of fruits and veggies every day, and lots of coconut milk. Oh, and lets not forget beans and rice, unprocessed kinds of course. Despite my high fat diet, I am dropping fat weekly. While there may or may not be a profound effect with this oil, I can safely say that it hasn't added any fat. In fact, I am pretty certain that it aids in fat metabolisation. Plus, you get a rare type of MCT with this product, which makes up nearly 70% of the fat contained in the oil.<br /><br />On a side note... DON'T BE AFRAID OF PLANT FATS!! You want to lose weight? Stop eating processed foods (ALL TYPES), eat beans and bulk rice (Wild, Forbidden, Long Grain Brown, Red Rice etc..), nuts/seeds, nutbutter and coconut! Oh, and veggies too of course. Its easy AND CHEAP to eat well. It took me quite some time to be able to figure out how to eat so well on a less than stellar budget, but it can be done! &lt;3"

I bought this back in January originally for my hair since I'm an African American woman with 3c/4a natural hair. and while it has done WONDERS growing my hair, I've been even more amazed by its other talents. If you use it as an occasional moisturizer it will leave you skin sooooooo soft. I also use it now as a substtute of oil/butter when I'm using my frying pan. You can hardly taste it, and when you do it doesn't taste bad at all. And it works better than oil and butter in my opinion. I'm not a chef but it seems to still burn a little bit when you use oil or butter. With this coconut oil, i just pour a dime size in the pan and use a paper towel to distribute it evenly so it give it a nice gloss. I let it heat for just a few seconds, add my food, and then wa la! no burning, and no more unnecessary calories. I will credit it (along with my diet and exercise) for allowing me to lose 30 pounds this summer. WOOH!"

I had developed some allergic reactions to some items in man-made lotions and my naturopath recommended using organic coconut oil instead.  I LOVE this oil.  It has a light coconut smell that does not linger too long.  I use this all over including on my face and my skin has been more moist (no longer do my legs get dry looking), my face less oily and with fewer blemishes.  My husband has noted that my skin looks younger and fresher.  It DOES take a while to soak in so I have had to adjust my routine a bit to avoid getting oil on things but have yet to stain any clothing or other items.  I tried a couple brands I found at the store prior to ordering this after reading the reviews and have found the brand I will remain loyal to in Nature's Way Effagold.<br /><br />I have also used this in cooking and love the light coconut taste it adds to food.  I still use EVOO for certain things as the taste just compliments certain foods better, but this oil has definitely been added to the diet and is in the rotation."

I previously used the Spectrum Naturals brand from a local grocery chain, but gave this one a try because it was a little less expensive. This coconut oil is far better in my opinion. It smells great in the jar, and smells AMAZING when cooking. I've used it for almost every meal I've needed oil for since getting it: browning meat, making crepes, even homemade marinades. When cooking a recipe with many ingredients the flavor tends to get lost, but for less complex meals (like lime shrimp I sauteed last week) you could taste a hint of coconut in the meal. What a fantastic addition! So far everyone, even our kids, has had nothing but rave reviews about it.<br /><br />It's summer and very warm here, so when we got our first jar it was completely liquid. It was a surprise to me, because every jar I'd bought at the store was always like a thick white paste. No worries; if that bothers you, just put in the fridge and it'll harden right up."

(Fife says the suggested dose is 3-4 tbs/day). The taste of this brand is fantastic, light and creamy with a delicious coconutty taste!

My wife and I had both read multiple books and articles that stated how healthy Coconut oil is and we are constantly looking for ways to improve our diets. We have since incorporated it into many aspects of our diets. In particular, its amazing with some of the juicing recipes we have come up with. I also enjoy cooking with it, but only with certain meals. Its important to note that cooking oils at high temperatures really cuts down on the nutritional content. So we always cook at lower temperatures when using Coconut or Olive oil. Anyways, we have come to love Coconut oil and it now has a permanent spot in our food pantry.<br /><br />We also started making homemade soap a few years back and while we didn't use coconut oil originally, we figured we would try it since we already had jars of it sitting on our shelves. Well, to make a long story short, its now incorporated in every single one of our recipes. In fact, my favorite soap is actually a recipe that focuses specifically on the coconut oil.<br /><br />Lastly, my wife one upped the soap making and started making homemade shampoo and conditioners and to say that they are amazing is a massive understatement. In particular, the conditioner she makes is unbelievable. I dont know the recipes but I do know that coconut oil is one of the major ingredients that she uses. My hair has never been softer and neither has hers. On top of that the smell is absolutely hypnotic.<br /><br />Bottom line - 12 months ago Coconut oil had absolutely no place in our home. Fast forward to today and....well, it now plays an major role in our lives, both for dietary and hygienic purposes. Even if you dont make homemade soaps, the health benefits alone should be more than enough for you to incorporate Coconut oil into your diet. Its one of the healthiest oils out there.<br /><br />Highly Recommended."

As a mattef of fact I keep it in my bedroom during showering so the steam from the shower won't won't liquify it because once it liquifies it will eventually reharden at room temperature but the consistency changes which to me also changes the chemical structure in it or something because it just doesn't moisturize the same afterwards.

I live in a predominantly white neighborhood and it is very hard finding things that work for my hair. So, I have to go to neighborhoods out of my way or shop online. And after finding out I bought conditioner that was mixed with bleach (clorox) from an online store that turned my hair into straw/ash it can be very frustrating. So I had to cut off my hair about 5 inches and I'm re-growing it. I had to file a claim with the business bureau and everything.

It melts immediately and adds a crisp to whatever savory dish you are making.  The faint, but identifiable taste of coconut oil makes the dish even BETTER.  SERIOUSLY, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?  With all the positive reviews, purchasing an item for the first time can be a tiny, wee bit difficult for a newbie.  However, if you are planning to eat healthy and use better cooking alternative oils and saturate your food with a bit more fat (good fat), use coconut oil.

Not only is it the most effective solution I've come across, it's also natural & the cheapest.<br /><br />I can't really comment on its other curative properties aside from skincare. I would advise against it in favor of jojoba oil. Coconut oil is heavier & may clog pores. However, it doesn't deserve to get knocked for that considering how well it works on hair.<br /><br />Also, the oil will congeal if it gets in the low 70s. Don't freak out, it's still good & less messy to apply since you can get a good amount on your fingers. If you can't get down like that, just put it in hot water & it will return to its liquid state. Oh, and be careful if you intend to take it as a supplement. You have to ease your body into it & only take a little at a time, like if you're trying to build an immunity to arsenic. Unknowingly, I took the recommended amount (jar, I trusted you!) & proceeded to have my insides torn apart.<br /><br />So, if you can remember these tips, you'll be well on your way to beautiful hair!"

It leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day without a heavy oily feel. I also use it as part of my hair regimen. I mix it with shea butter and jojoba oil to moisturize my natural locs. Finally, it is food grade. I use it as a spread on toast instead of butter and jams. It has a light sweet taste. Overall, I love this product and it is of high quality."

Bake with it as a substitute for other butters/oils in recipes. And statistically, how can one person not be happy with at least one of these options that coconut oil offers? Honestly, this is the smartest purchase I have ever made, I will never go back to putting butter on toast, the coconut flavor is absolutely delicious. The texture is much lighter and it just smells so.amazingly.GOOD.

My hair strands are fine but I do have a lot of hair and it is relatively long. My scalp is also naturally a little oily. My hair is healthy, but I do need deep conditioning though as I expose my hair to a lot of elements. (I give all of this detail in case someone is making the decision for themselves as identifies with my hair profile.)<br /><br />My Hubby is a hairdresser / salon owner and because of this I get to try all kinds of hair products.  I've even had expensive caviar shampoo and conditioner (As I roll my eyes). I've used other oils in my hair and most require several washings to get the oil out.  Not this Coconut Oil.  I put it on my dry hair at night and wrap a satin wrapping cap around it while I sleep.  (available near the relaxer s in the hair care section of the store) When I wake I shampoo an condition like normal and my hair looks amazing! I use it twice a week now!<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />Nothing and I mean nothing has made my hair feel as silky and look as shiny as this Coconut Oil.<br /><br />The oil starts out think like crisco but melts in your hands when rubbed together quickly.

I ate some of this with coconut cookies and couldn't stop until I accepted that it is oil... so I can't be eating insane amounts of it. Very nice that it has good fats in it as well. I used a bit as  moisturizer for my face after it was quite dry and my face was supppppppper hydrated and moist after, so make sure you barely put as much as the size of this 'O' on your finger tip."
367682,B003B3OOPA,A1V6QOMVTUH0AN,"Piraha Mura ""Piraha""",1,1,4,1348185600,I like the product,"But there is something strange about the packaging.  My home is constantly over 76F, so it is always a liquid.  When it arrived, the box was partially soaked with coconut oil.  I can't find the leak and the bottle and inner seal seems to be ok.  Since I only use it for hair and skin care, I am keeping it.<br /><br />The smell is really nice and not overwhelming.  Maybe it's the only oil available in bulk that do not put off people with the smell.<br /><br />Update: It's the same thing when my other oils arrived.  They are dense.  Since their bottles are almost unbreakable, they packaging is normally just big air bubbles loosely around them.  They experience violence forces during transit.  The bottles have a pretty normal secure seal like any normal products in the supermarket.  But their seal broke during individual transit.  That explains the slight leaks.  When fall comes, the oil turn into a beautiful solid.<br /><br />Now I understand what is a light oil.  Coconut oil is not.  You can't apply it to your hair without using a normal shampoo to remove the greasy feeling.  The strong greasy feeling that you cannot stand going to bed with it in your dry hair.  You may want a thick oil for the skin though.  You got instant soft skin even for hardened sole.  But whether it does anything to the skin long term is another story.<br /><br />BTW, many other oils are near odourless.  This oil is the exception that have a faint coconut odour to it."

After doing a bit of research, I chose this product in particular due to the description, reviews, pricepoint, and the fact that it is a brand I have seen in many stores and am familiar with.<br /><br />The non-processed nature of this oil meets my skincare and haircare needs, but also makes it perfect for cooking as well. I bought it to use in the shower but now I cannot stop eating it on everything! It has a wonderfully light coconut smell and flavor, which is clearly natural and not from any artificial colorings or flavors. This is the best brand of coconut oil I have ever bought and it blends into my skin quickly and softly without feeling overly oily, tastes amazing, and washes out of my hair easily.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that it is packaged in a plastic container. While I am not too worried about the plastic leaching chemicals into the oil itself, I will be buying this product for the rest of my life and I'm sure I will be accumulating a lot of these plastic jars! Though they're recyclable, a glass jar would get reused immediately in my house. Other than that, I am perfectly pleased with this product! For the price, this can't be beat, it's worth spending the ~$10 to try it.<br /><br />Note: I couldn't find where this coconut product was harvested from on Amazon or the EfaGold website, but the bottle itself says it's a product of the Phillipines."

You seriously only need about 1-2 teaspoon and my hair is about 1 and 1/2 feet long. My hair was SO soft! My sister eventually asked why I kept running my hands through my hair all day (I'm still doing it right now :D). And the reason for that is because it was softer and silkier, but MOSTLY it helped keep my hair tangle-free.<br /><br />Before I purchased this, I read some other reviews that claimed it was great for acne. I don't know why but it did not work for me. I only use a teeny bit on my face after a shower and the next day, I had a few whiteheads. At first I thought, ""well maybe its supposed to be like this before it gets any better"".. But it has been 5 days and it keeps getting worse. I am VERY disappointed.

It seems all other oils, including mineral, olive, and sunflower can only coat the hair, at best a temporary cure.<br /><br />What makes coconut oil special? Its about 90% saturated fatty acid which contains about 40% lauric acid. Among it's almost mythical and magical properties it is ""reputed"" to cure a host of maladies including high cholesterol, obesity, infections,(all highly doubtful)and dry hair and skin (believable). It is also a food product that can be used as a butter substitute a shortening and a frying oil. My interest, however, is hair, just hair.<br /><br />Interestingly, coconut oil solidifies at temperatures under 76 degrees Fahrenheit. If you live in an air conditioned home in a temperate climate, this oil will be solid most of the time. I decanted a few teaspoons into a small container from the wide jar the product comes in. I keep the original container in the refrigerator and the small one in the bathroom where it is usually much warmer than the rest of my house.<br /><br />When liquefied, this oil is fairly thick and milky looking. It smells deliciously of coconut. To me it tastes of .... coconut grease....but not in a totally bad way.<br /><br />To use this as a hair conditioner one needs to start slowly and experiment. Although my hair is thick it has a fairly fine texture. The first few times I used the oil I over applied it and my hair became flat and greasy looking.<br /><br />As a hair conditioner, it is recommended to coat your dry hair and scalp with the oil, cover your head with a towel and let it penetrate for an hour or two. Using non-conditioning shampoo, apply a small amount to your dry hair and rub it in without adding any water at first. Then, after the shampoo has been rubbed in, add small amounts of warm water until you build up a lather. Rinse, then shampoo again normally. Your hair will be very soft and smooth.<br /><br />As a hair dressing, use only a very tiny amount unless your have thick, very curly or kinky hair. I gave a friend with long thick curly hair some of the oil and she is completely in love with it.<br /><br />A little of this product goes a very long way. A jar should last a very long time. Besides, if you don't like it as a hair product, you can always eat it!"

I just couldn't stomach the $16 price tag from Whole Foods anymore for the exact same product. I received it today, it has the exact same exp date on the package (I know that is an issue with some items on Amazon, products being too close to the exp date and maybe that is why you got it at a bargain price).<br />Came well packaged with the seal intact, no problems. I will buy it again from this seller. And with Amazon Prime, it makes it a super bargain!<br />Also, if you are doing your research on the many amazing properties coconut oil possesses, you know that it is anti-bacterial. I discovered almost 3 yrs ago that I was allergic to antiperspirant/deo. My armpits would itch and I would scratch them almost raw. When I stopped using anti/deo, the itch stopped. Looking around online, this happens to many people. What to do? Well, I went to Whole Foods and bought plenty of natural deos that did not work AT ALL! Good for me they take back anything, including used deo. I researched and found a recipe for coconut oil deo. It has cornstarch, baking soda, and coconut oil. I followed a recipe, (google coconut oil deodorant recipe) formed it into an old deo container, and what do you know? It works like a charm! NO ODOR! It does not stop sweat, but guess what folks? You are supposed to sweat under your armpits, it is your body's way of detoxifying itself. Sweat smells when the bacteria from the skin and the perspiration meet in a dark, warm place- the armpit. The EVCO inhibits the production of bacteria. You have a serious amount of lymph nodes there that need the freedom to move toxins out of your body. And we wonder why women get breast cancer more and more these days. When I have important social events or meeting I use a regular antiperspirant, but 90% of the time I use this. Keep in fridge in warmer climates, it melts at 76 degrees F.<br /><br />Coconut oil is truly amazing stuff, give it a try. Can't hurt."

367767,B003B3OOPA,A2CHWR128F31M5,Melissa Yost,1,1,5,1332201600,Great for smoothies!!,"I bought this and another brand to try and both are equally as good.  I do like the clear container that this comes in though better so this is the brand I will stick with.  It comes in a clear plastic container and I don't notice any plastic taste as others have commented on coconut oil in general.  I just put a big spoonful in my magic bullet when I make smoothies!  So yummy!!  You can eat this straight out of the jar if you want to also.  It is good!  When I first got it (shipped in the winter), it was pretty firm and I had to scrape it with a spoon to get it out..like candle wax.  But once it warmed up a bit..just room temperature, it is very soft now.  It still is a solid though, but easier to work with.  It is similar to the inside of an Almond Joy candy bar at room temp.  I can't comment on health affects since I am a relatively healthy person with bloodwork that shows great results..so far, but am only 34 yrs old.  I love coconut and hope it can help with brain function, memory mostly..lol.  I hope if I start taking it now, it will help long term. Once I run out, I will be getting the largest jar for my money!  My husband and kids love the smoothies made with this! It's not overpowering either..just the perfect hint of coconut among the other fruit and veggies. I made mango, pineapple, banana, and coconut smoothies that were just awesome!! Even all blended up well, you can still see the tiny white coconut flakes within the smoothies. Just yummy!!"

My youngest doesn't like the smell but what does she know, she's only 9, everyone else in the house loves it.  My first jar lasted about a month, but I had to split some of it up so I'd have some in the bathroom and the rest in the kitchen.  I like that it doesn't liquify until you put in on your skin, it only liquified once(it was over 75 degress where I had it) and I put in the frig, however; when I took it out it was too hard.  You'll be very happy when you purchase this and needless to say it came very quickly, I'm on the prime membership so I rec'd it in 2 days.  I love it so much that I'm having a fit because I ran out.

It made them taste better than butter ever did! After doing a little more research I found there are SOOOO many other beneficial uses. So, I have taken to using it on my hair and skin.

I don't notice it so much when I eat it, but I do when I'm using it as a moisturizer. It's not that big of a deal though.

I took about a generous tablespoon in my first ingestion attempt. Mind you, I've previously used other coconut oils before, but I would have to say the were greatly inferior to this product.<br /> I felt ill to the stomach within 30-45 minutes of consuming the tablespoon...I did what every American does, I googled. Turns out that it's common for those who have an overabundance of yeast in the system.  I drink tons of beer, well Belgian wheat ale to be exact, and the coconut oil reportedly acts as a detox according to some holistic opinions. I'm willing to give it a  further try. I think it's best that you ease into coconut oil therapy vice gobbling a juicy tablespoon of it. I will update this review in a few months, but few on people  on Amazon report experiencing any malaise from consuming coconut oil and I had to do a quick search to learn how common it is.<br />Otherwise, I concur that this is a superior product and if any true benefit would be redeemed from ingesting coconut oil, this would be one of the key ones to try."

I guess there's coconut shortage."
367832,B003B3OOPA,A2T0V99GLGXWCM,Ghost(Ghost(M)),9,13,5,1314662400,"Very good product, but a 60% price increase in a week?","I bought a jar of this thing on Aug 16 for seven bucks (and free delivery if over Amazon's minimum for such). It came pretty fast, in a semi-liquid state but not leaking; rather well packaged. I let it melt completely in a warm room (CO melts at about 80 deg F) and then put it in the fridge to let it solidify. One of the reasons I did (and always do) that is to smooth out the texture: as is, every type of CO I've tried comes in like a bunch of white fibers stuck in more even liquid, but if you thaw it completely and then freeze, it becomes all evenly semi-transparent, like one thick candle sort of thing. It probably doesn't matter; just a personal quirk, I guess.<br /><br />Anyway, this is good stuff: the taste is nice -- very good for sweetich things like carrots or plums, for example (I always have a bowl of very lightly steamed carrots around, and I snack on them, taking one and dipping it into CO, which is good for two reasons: first, it tastes great, and second, carotene is fat-soluble so you need to combine carrots with some sort of fat or it won't be used by the body well).<br /><br />All in all, there isn't much to say -- CO is CO is CO; this kind is no different from other types I've tried. CO in general is shamelessly hyped as a sort of panacea from every health problem known to man; this is mostly lies, but two things are true: it is tasty, and it's good for skin/hair (I've tried both, and it's true, it works). Don't believe anything else and don't ""take"" it daily as if it were a medicine: it's pure saturated fat and that's the end of it: it will raise your cholesterol as any other kind of saturated fat. As far as its being a weight-loss agent, this is not a complete lie, but remember, it works only if you _substitute_ CO for other kinds of saturated fats (that means quit eating butter, meat, etc.) If, otoh, you simply _add_ it to your normal diet, you're not gonna lose any weight -- instead, you're gonna gain weight at least as good as you would otherwise + increase your cholesterol. But if you decide to substitute, do not think it's an easy choice: CO is pure saturated fat, whereas other sources of saturated fats (butter, meat, etc.) come with a lot of nutritional goodness like vitamins, proteins, and the like -- things that CO is wholly devoid of. So my suggestion, for what it's worth (not much, I know) is to use CO just as another agreeable food to be used in moderation, not a magic medicine. I read somewhere that a 40-sh male in good health on a 2000 cal/day diet can get 200 calories from saturated fats w/o harming himself.<br /><br />One other thing I wanted to mention: the jar says it's ""pure extra virgin"" -- keep in mind that ""extra virgin"" is meaningful only when applied to olive oil. That is because there are specific and stringent industry standards stipulating what constitutes ""virgin"", ""extra virgin"", etc. There are no such standards about any other oils, so saying your CO is ""extra virgin"" communicates zero useful information and is no more than disingenuous hand-waving. It's like Nutiva says on their jars ""no cholesterol!"". No kidding, it's like wood-free nails. Of course plant-derived foods have no cholesterol, but BS rules in this industry, so just be aware of what's what and smart enough to dismiss useless hype like claims of a CO being ""extra virgin"".<br /><br />OK, there's really no more to say: as long as you use this tasty substance rationally, it's good stuff, so bottomline is: recommended -- except for one thing: just as I was deciding it's time to post a review and navigating to this page, I noticed that the price went up by the mind-blowing 60 percent since, not just since I bought it (two weeks ago), but literally within the last few days. Does my salary go up 60 percent in a couple of days? No. So, while the product is good and I can't give it less than five stars, I will suggest you do not reward naked greed and at least try to find better-priced alternatives. Especially in this economic environment that we have right now. The current price here is even higher than it is in Wegman's (brick-and-mortar grocery store; they carry it, but it's more than the seven bucks I bought it for here).<br /><br />PS. Btw, I see now someone reports that this oil comes in a glass jar: this is a bare-faced lie. The jar is transparent plastic, quite soft actually, so you can't _honestly_ mistake it for glass. Be extremely suspicious about these massive five-star reviews (here and elsewhere); I for a long time have a feeling those are posted by manufacturers' employees to create hype (and why not? Amazon does nothing to guard against fake reviews; all one needs to do in order to start posting reviews (real OR fake) is buy something once from this site). Some reviews read like the reviewer hasn't actually seen the product in question and is interested only in adding another five-star rating, not the review.<br /><br />PPS. Thanks to commenters Lulu and Adriana for additional info and helpful suggestions."

It is solid at room temperature but I prefer it in liquid form which I achieve by running the jar under hot water. I take 1 tbsp about 3-4 times a day and use this as a moisturizer after the shower. It tastes yummy but I did have to get used to the feeling that I was swallowing oil. My hubby had no problem w this and even joked it was so good that he could drink it with a straw. I have suffered w a systemic yeast infection for years which has caused numerous skin problems and a nasty white tongue. This has cleared that up in a week. The pimples I had on my arms and thighs are gone and so are my undereye dark circles. My nails are growing smoothly and my hair stopped falling out when I brush. I also started using it as a vaginal moisturizer and I am extremely pleased with the results. I also noticed how it helped with my cold. My symptoms were mild whereas everyone else had a more severe reaction. It also helped with my cracking feet and my pinky toe, which has been blackened forever, is returning to normal. I love using it on the kids lips because I know when they lick it off it's not harmful. My hubby started taking it as well when he saw how I benefited and he loves the natural burst of energy he gets after. My daughter finally tried some and now loves it on her madelines in the morning. I cant say enough wonderful things about this product. I feel like a brand new person. I wish doctors knew more to recommend this instead of blaming loss of energy and skin problems on aging.

It's so good that I'm going to subscribe to it.<br />UPDATE: I still LOVE this product and use it daily. I've found it makes the best pancakes when you grease the griddle w some. It is an excellent wood cleaner and the only way I clean wood, now. I also make a lip scrub w a drop of coconut oil in the palm of my kids' hands and a pinch of sugar. They love how yummy it is, I don't worry if they get it in their mouths, and they no longer have dry, cracking winter lips.

Dutton,14,14,5,1307059200,Wonderful Product,"Recently, I wanted to ""up the ante"" on my Omega fatty acids so I added Coconut oil to go along with my doses of flaxseed oil and fish oil. Yes, Coconut Oil is a saturated fat, but because it's a medium chain tryclyceride (MCT), it's more easily absorbed by the body and converted into energy, not stored on the body as fat. This product has a nice flavor--I use it in cooking and it doesn't depart any heavy ""coconut"" flavor. Sometimes I just eat a tablespoon. The benefits are tremendous: microbial properties, helps thyroid, liver, pancreas, bones, skin, soothes the digestive tract. The list goes on.<br /><br />I bought one jar for the kitchen and one jar for my bathroom. This product is great to put on right after a bath or shower. Yes it's a bit greasy at first, but rub it in well and let it absorb, then wipe off the excess with a damp towel or wash cloth.

Lotions required constant reapplication, so they were expensive and inconvenient. Ointments were too thick and would make my skin hot and sometimes exacerbate itching. Baby oil didn't seem thick enough. The best solution I found was dissolving a bit of ointment in sesame oil with a dab of steroid ointment to control itching. It was okay, but not great. Plus, I quickly tired of smelling like popcorn.<br /><br />My dermatologist recommended that I try coconut oil. I've been astonished by how well it works. After only two days of use, my eczema rashes had faded considerably because they longer itched. Patches that I had for months were suddenly gone. The rest of my skin no longer feels dry and tight, which means no new rashes! I only have to apply coconut oil in the morning and after my shower with no need to reapply throughout the day. Best of all, I smell (quite literally) like a fresh coconut right after I apply it, and the scent fades rather quickly (so I don't get sick of it).<br /><br />I realize this sounds too good to be true, and I'll be sure to update if the product suddenly stops working.

Also it absorbs very quickly into the skin leaving it soft but not greasy and there is slight coconut smell but it fades quickly once absorb into the skin.  It is a bit pricey and is definitely an investment.

I wanted to wait until I had an opportunity to really use the product in many ways and to gauge the results.  I started out taking tablespoon as soon as I purchased it...and soon discovered that other reviewers are correct - some people have to work their way up to taking a tablespoon. Now I take a table spoon in the morning mixed with a protein shake. Sometimes, I mix it in hot coffee or tea. I have also started taking an additional tablespoon in the afternoon either spread on crackers or a small piece of bread.  As a food, it gives me an extra boost of energy and seems to make me more alert.  I have begun to lose weight but I am not certain if this is because of the coconut oil or because I have implemented a walking routine. Either way, it gave me the energy to want to get up and get moving! I also use it as a moisturizer on my skin. It does go on rather oily, but it absorbs quickly. I just have to make certain that I give myself enough time for the oil to absorb before putting on certain fabrics. I was in awe regarding how soft my skin felt. Rough patches are now smooth.  I have stopped using a popular African American hair moisturizer on my son's hair and began using this.  All I can say is his hair loves coconut oil. It improved his texture.  I have also used it on an area of his head that seemed prone to razor bumps.  It is healing well. Finally, I read that this is safe for dogs.

As it feels very smooth on your face.<br />Just try out how much to use, not more then half of a small nail size for sure, otherwise it will be to oily.<br />I was reluctant to try tasting it, but it really tasts very good, unless you hate coconut.<br />Will definitely try it for cooking as I have two different containers.<br /><br />When I had a small acne breakout, and one of those undercover pimples that threaten to come out and stay around for days it was gone in 3-4 days and never surfaced. So so far very good. Will keep using it and update accordingly.<br /><br />Only thing I want to caution everyone, after showering I decided to use it as all over body oil, I recall rubbing it in , but obviously not good enough , as I did go to bed an hour or so later, and the next morning I noticed dark grey stained spots on the bedsheet, I tried to wash them and use stain remover but no luck, I also saw there were some stains on the bathrope.

I bought other coconut oil mostly due to the fact that it was the same price as olive oil and I thought it was ""all natural"" as it basically stated it on the container.  After reading reviews of the other stuff I bought not being organic I decided to give this a try.  While this is definitely pricier, the difference is astounding!  If you like the taste of coconuts, this is the bomb.  The other tasted nothing like coconuts, or really anything at all, so when I opened the container of this I was quite intrigued.  I put this on vegetables and when I cook fish and it definitely helps with the vegetables since I have to generally force myself to eat them.  With that said, I don't think I would buy this product again simply due to price.  I would go to another brand assuming they are as good since you can buy much more for only a little bit more in cost.  This changed my whole view toward organic, and hopefully makes me healthier.  If you read this review look at all the stuff they put in processed food ... specifically benzene!  I work in chemical plants, so I know how terrible this stuff is, and the fact they use it in food processing blows my mind!  Also, the fact that they don't have to tell you is even crazier.

I read the label carefully because I was concerned about whether or not to refrigerate.  The label clearly said that refrigeration was not required.  However, after appx. 2 weeks of using as a daily dietary supplement, I began to notice an awful cramping, nauseous feeling not long after I took it.  It was the sickest I have ever felt in my entire life and I repeated it just to be sure that it was the coconut oil causing it and not something else I had eaten.  Same thing again.  All I can figure is the oil went rancid.  There's no other explanation for why it suddenly started causing me to be sick.  So, word to the wise, consider refrigerating this product.  I've stopped using it altogether because I now associate the smell of it with sickness. :("

Shelnutt ""Mystery Novelist""",8,13,5,1276819200,"Alive, Ageless, Gourmet and Gathering Years... meaning the oil!]","<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 9:15 Mins<br /><br /></span>Some say the COCONUT palm is the Tree of Life.  They say Life is honored and perpetuated through its meat, its water, its oil, its presence.<br /><br />In my opinion, EVAGold, and the Nutiva brand of coconut oil shown in the video, are among the highest qualities available, of life healing offerings from this sacred gift of a tree.  I had sensed this cold pressed oil's uncanny value as soon as I saw a picture of a jar of EVAGold on Swanson's product list on Amazon.  I had come to trust Swanson [as much as I continue to trust Amazon] from purchases of several types of magnesium supplements including <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026RCMAG"">Magnesium Oil 8 fl oz Spray</a>.<br /><br />Reading Bruce Fife's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q360CS"">The COCONUT OIL MIRACLE</a>, provided necessary information for working  with this fruit.  Reading that book also clarified my previous belief in the healing nutrition in coconut oil, and in these brands' production purity [other excellent brands are also available; these two are just the ones I've used successfully so far].  My experience of using this type of cold pressed, virgin coconut oil for only 24 hours had shown results which made me feel blessed!<br /><br />I've been slowly and steadily rectifying a serious magnesium deficiency while searching for what felt like a missing catalyst or synergistic essence which would cause magnesium supplementation to be accepted by the body, and then seated into the cellular level of life enhancing operations.  Dr. Carolyn Dean's book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ODEPY4"">The MAGNESIUM MIRACLE</a> is an excellent guide to Magnesium's magic in healing, normalizing, and strengthening the embodied human soul.  I've been thinking that coconut, in its several forms of use, could work as a catalyst for magnesium, while magnesium works as a catalyst for all other nutrients, including coconut oil, to function correctly.  What a team!!<br /><br />To understand the vital message in what I'm trying to say here, please be cajoled or even coerced (jokingly) into reading some of my Amazon.com reviews on magnesium products and the two books linked above... as a start on a journey to understanding, appreciating, and relishing LIFE.  Other great Magnesium and Coconut books and products are available, easily found using search capacities.<br /><br />According to some experts, the most important thing to know about oils, fats, and coconut products is that they should be gently, minimally, and carefully processed by cold pressing, preferably labeled ANH (absolutely no heat used in processing); the reasons for this are detailed in Fife's book.<br /><br />Also according to some experts, the most important thing to know about magnesium is that it needs to be held in highest priority and percentage in the minerals taken into the body, and that certain foods, additives, and supplements can defeat bio-availability of magnesium.  Especially calcium needs to be taken in much lower amounts than magnesium, and in the current food marketplace and general eating habits; calcium is usually assimilated in large quantities, causing illnesses related to calcification or deposits, and contributing to magnesium deficiency.  This situation is detailed in Dr. Dean's book.<br /><br />My main concern with coconut usage for persons like me who are severely deficient in magnesium is that most offerings of coconut I'm aware of hold more potassium than magnesium, which could upset the balance and primary necessity of magnesium.<br /><br />In my non-professional opinion magnesium is the INDEX nutritional substance; the A-Priori for Life.<br /><br />Maybe even the Tree of Life needs magnesium as its priority nutrient...<br /><br />With adequate magnesium held within the cell structures... [some experts say cells need to retain 10,000 times more magnesium than any other mineral]... the body can adequately and correctly utilize other minerals and necessary nutrients, in order to live strong and disease free. [See my review of Dr. Dean's book.]<br /><br />Maybe magnesium seats life, coconut is the cozy catalyst, and taste buds rule!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />Other excellent coconut oils available on Amazon:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAT6NG"">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 54-Ounce Jar</a><br />[The link above goes to the large size, the one I showed in my review on Bruce Fife's book]<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64"">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)</a> [This is the product used in the video here.

I would have written something earlier about this, but I just haven't had the time.  Every time I look in the jar though, it still shocks me.  I wondered if it was due to the way the product was packaged.  Maybe it rolled onto its side and caused the top to be more full and the right side to be empty, however, it wasn't full to the top.  Also it's solid and I didn't order it during the warm months for it to be liquid and change.  So, yes, I feel ripped off.

Make sure to put it on last as a sealant for any other moisturizers that you use. I feel a lot better knowing that something I am putting onto my skin and absorbing into my bloodstream does not contain a mass of impossible to pronounce ingredients.

My baby is 5 months old and after 24 hours of applying this oil from head to toe, his red patches were significantly reduced.  My whole family was amazed at the results.  No, it is not a cure but it is a good moisturizer to use on a baby with eczema, espeically for the face since my baby sucks on his hands, rubs it all over his cheeks and then takes it right back into his mouth.<br />I decided to take 3 tsps a day (now a bit more because I love the taste and texture so much) as a supplements since it has antifungal and lots of lauric acid (found in breastmilk) which strengthens the immune system.  I was hoping that some of it will get passed on to my milk and help my son fight his eczema from the inside.  Actually, I read that eating just 3 tsps a day, the lauric acid content in breastmilk jumps up from 3% to 9%.  As far as the results, I don't know if the coconut oil through my breastmimlk helped him but I sure got hooked!  I love the taste, texture, and look forward to taking my suuplemental tlbs.  I plan to bake with it this weekend and have asked my husband to use it for cooking as well.  I've rubbed some on my hands and face and it feels really soft and well moisturized.

It hurt, throb, left scars, terrible blemishes, cystic acne along my cheek and chin area, very oily t-zone, large pores on my cheeks, blackheads and dry patchy areas. Worse thing about it I had new ones almost everyday and my chest and acne were the same.<br />Desperate I read up all the natural benefits in using coconut oil internally and externally and it i knew it wouldn't hurt to try. My face was terrible as it is. Anyway when I started applying this externally, my back and chest acne lessen within a month and a half. I have to say it didn't disappear like magic however I notice my skin felt smoother, my skin tone was more even than before,my dry patchy area disappeared and best of all less acne. But my cystic acne still kept coming.<br />So determined I changed my chemical based products into 100% natural. Basic natural cleanser, toner, and moisturizer which is my bestfriend coconut oil and also a healthy diet. Within 6 months of using this externally and internally my face is completely clear with only a once and while breakout and I'm currently 1 month away from being 20 and almost getting to flawless. Except my acne scars is a huge problem for me for the moment.<br />My sisters and I also use it for deep hair conditioning, and some facial treatments.<br />Coconut Oil is creamy and delicious as well. I love eating this with my toast and putting it in my favorite coconut chicken curry. I've noticed when eating coconut oil or just adding it into my food my appetite isn't as big as it was before. Not sure if its because its a healthy type of fat.But anyway I absolutely love, love , love this product.<br /><br />however with the acne part, its not for everyone.

It's like a miracle oil. Highly recommend it."
368067,B003B3OOPA,A1SGUI3RORSZ33,Arash M,9,9,5,1309132800,"Delicious and Fresh, no complaints in regards to the product quality...BUT","I love this coconut oil, I ordered 4 quantities and all of them were super fresh and tasted very delicious. The texture was great and it's a joyous treat to use every time. Coconut oil has many uses, but I use it mainly as a dietary supplement. I use it to cook my morning eggs or sauteing vegetables with the omelet, add some to my oatmeal every morning, put a little in my tea or coffee, add some to my protein or fruit shakes, or just take it by the spoonful which is melt in your mouth deliciousness.<br />I am a very active person and a health nut, and I follow a low-carb diet and way of life, so I put great emphasis on consuming lots of quality oils and fats in my diet. Coconut oil makes the perfect addition. I am 100% satisfied with the quality of this coconut oil.<br /><br />However, having said all of this, one thing that I wish was different about the product was the package. The jar is plastic and my limited knowledge in chemistry points me to the old knowledge that ""like dissolves like""... and since oils and plastics are both derived from nonpolar substances, this leads me to worry that there will be plastic leaking into the oil. Albeit this is a tremendously slow process, nonetheless it still makes me second guess coming back to this product and purchasing a brand that uses glass jars instead. If they change their packaging methods, I will have no problem purchasing this brand again. Although, I did not take off any stars for this reason because most coconut oil packages these days seem to come in plastic containers, so it wouldn't be fair to rate this brand less than others.<br /><br />One thing that I have done to lessen my worry is to refrigerate the oil so that it solidifies. My rationale behind this is that less oil is in contact with the plastic container when the oil is solidified because only the edges touch as opposed to a liquid form, which is constantly mixing and makes more surface area contact. I actually like to take my coconut oil when solidified because I like how it melts slowly when eaten and you can savor the taste better.<br /><br />I hope this helped others."

Of course that's all changed now, and coconut oil is recognized as one of the 'good' oils - but it was still only recently that I had a chance to try it for myself.  Wow!  It's great stuff.<br /><br />Coconut oil has a unique quality in that it has a melting point of 76 degrees, F - and out here where I live (Oregon), that means I seldom see it as a liquid oil (even in summer) - but that's fine with me, for one of the things I like using it for is in biscuits and pie crust, and for those, it has to be solid - and as a solid fat, coconut oil is quite hard (really hard!), even when close to 75 degrees - and for that reason, it is much better for use in baking, where a hard fat works much better than a soft one.<br /><br />But another characteristic of coconut oil that I love is its flavor and aroma - when you open the jar and stick your nose down in it, you are enveloped in the beauty of the coconut's best element, its aroma - its almost frightening how beautiful that smell is.  Maybe it's just me, but that aroma literally sends me to the tropics each time I open the jar.<br /><br />And then there's the flavor.  Most fats have little or no flavor - in fact, as cooks we've been taught to use a fat with no flavor in our cooking.  However, we all know that many fats are flavor!  And if we remove the fat, we lose much of the flavor.  Well friends, coconut oil is a fat with super flavor!  Anything you make with it will have the subtle flavor of the topics - I use it when I make rice, when I do S E Asian dishes and curries, and to make great scrambled eggs.  When you begin using it, coconut oil will open new doors of creativity in your cooking - and you will love it too."

The product arrived quickly and as a liquid (I live in FL and it is summer- i expected this), and the smell is just sooooo delicious!!I have not used it in cooking yet, as I started using it topically and want to order a separate batch to cook with, but I have to say I am completely BLOWN away by the effects it has had on my skin already. I am a fair skinned female and have always been a target for mosquitoes. For most of my life I have been embarrassed by the multiple and never ending itchy, ugly bug bites and rashes these annoying little things have left on my skin. (mostly my ankles and legs) and am sometimes reluctant to wear shorts, dresses, and things that don't cover my legs (Which can be very difficult, considering just how HOT it is in FL)because it makes me feel self conscious and less confident about myself.<br /><br />Naturally, when I received the product the first place I started lathering it onto was my feet and legs, and I continued to do this several times a day. I WISH I had taken a before and after photo, as I did NOT expect the results to turn out as they did. Within 2 days, many of the little red spots had COMPLETELY disappeared. Furthermore, the scars and marks that were left from previous encounters have started to fade and are becoming less noticeable each day. Mind you, I have only been using the stuff for about 2 weeks. But like I said, I am completely blown away by the effects thus far. Additionally, I have started to apply the oil to a few moles that I have, and am very excited to see if there are any results in a few weeks (I will follow up with this post as needed)<br /><br />I order items frequently from amazon.com, and do not have the time to review many of the things I purchase. However, the effects from the coconut oil literally seemed to good to be true and now I know why many others have felt the need to 5 star review this product as well. I am a pharmacy student who is turning more and more to alternative treatments and natural remedies every day. I can not wait to be able to educate the public in regards to products such as this. And did I mention? I wore shorts to work for the first time the other day; no more self esteem issues, and my confidence is skyrocketing :)"

By itself, 1 Tbsp tastes very rich and coco-nutty. Too rich for me so, I decided to put it in a cup of coffee. It was delicious!! I used Columbian coffee (Green Mountain, Fair Trade Select K-Cup), sugar and some hemp milk (Pacific Natural Foods). That is definitely a keeper!! If you don't drink coffee, I'm sure it would work great in a cup of hot cocoa as well.<br /><br />Later, I decided to try it in some oatmeal. I mixed the following into a cup of cooked oatmeal: 1/2 Tsp cinnamon, 2-3 Tsp sugar, 1 Tbsp coconut oil. When the coconut oil melted completely, I added 3-4 Tbsp hemp milk to cool it down. My taste-buds were amazed!! Tomorrow, I will try this with raisins. Mmmmm.<br /><br />We make a lot of fruit shakes at our house and I've had coconut in them before, so I know this will taste great in a shake too. Here's the recipe I'm going with: Banana, Cantaloupe, Orange Juice, Ice, Hemp Milk, Honey (maybe) and Coconut Oil.<br /><br />I still have to find one more meal that I can add this to in order to keep up with the recommended 4 x 1 Tbsp daily dosage, but I'm sure it will be no problem to find something else that this goes well with."

I used the coconut oil along with the Suave Professional hair conditioner, put a plastic cap on my head and sat under the hair dryer for thirty-minutes with the hair dryer on the low setting, and noticed that my hair was much softer and easier to manage.  I have been natural for about a year and six months or longer (without a perm in my hair).  Since I noticed a difference in my hair I wanted to make sure that my hair was softer because of the coconut oil, because I had just started using the Suave Professional conditioner; so when it was time to shampoo my hair again, I put the same conditioner on my hair sat under the hair dryer for thirty minutes with the setting on low as usual without the coconut oil on my hair and noticed that my hair was not as soft as when I used the coconut oil on my hair in addition to the conditioner.  My hair was still soft, not to imply that Suave Professional is not a good conditioner and didn't make my hair soft.  However, my hair seemed much softer when I used the coconut oil and the conditioner on my hair.  It is also great to use on the scalp as well.  Usually when I grease my scalp with sulfur 8 fresh hair & scalp conditioner (in the yellow jar with the blue cap) after washing and conditioning my hair within three to four days I wash and grease my hair again because my scalp no longer feels clean.  Since I started greasing my scalp with the coconut oil first, just a very little on the scalp area, then put the sulfur 8 fresh hair and conditioner on my scalp on the same scalp area where I put the coconut oil, my scalp feels healthier; after only two treatments of greasing my hair with the coconut oil and sulfur 8.  I am assuming that using the coconut oil with any conditioner and any hair grease will make the hair and scalp feel healthier, softer and easier to manage.  I highly recommend using this product or any other coconut oil if you want to use the product to help with the conditioning of your hair and/or scalp."

The coconut did not overpower the foods in my recipes which I thought it would.<br />I used it on my face hair and body.  It is cooling and smooth, it does take a little time to soak in so I use it at night and in the morning I feel silky smooth.  It has not clogged my pores so I wake up and there are not blemishes.<br />It is also extremely good for your pets, cats dogs and birds.  My dog absolutely loves this but be careful you must start by giving a very small amount (1/4 tsp.)and build it up to a tsp. per 20 lbs. of animal over a month.  If you are not careful they will suffer from die back.  Google that, you may see Herxheimer's reaction, it is about the same thing and happens to humans also.

I heard about it and read up online and was amazed at the health benefits. I found this brand to have the best reviews/price so I went with it. I'm getting ready to purchase my 3rd one in as many months. It has a delicious yet subtle coconut flavor and is now one of only 3 oils I use in my cooking (+olive oil, avocado oil).<br /><br />My uses:<br />-Replace butter/fat/oil for non-stick cooking - except when using olive or avocado oil, this is my go to. In the skillet before eggs/bacon/pancakes/etc.<br />-On toast/pancakes etc. as a butter replacement - that little hint of coconut is delicious and the fattiness is reminiscent of butter.<br />-A tablespoon in my smoothies (for the health benefits)<br />-Oil replacement in baking recipes - it works just as well and is healthier!<br /><br />It's important to note that in cooking, the coconut flavor does not persist. If I add it raw I get that flavor but my eggs/bacon, for example, do not have coconut flavor after being cooked in this oil.<br /><br />HEALTHY: Read up on all the health benefits but here's the main one: yes this is a saturated fat. However, it's made up of medium-chain fatty acids. This type of fat is readily converted to energy and rarely stored as fat. Research shows that coconut oil (in moderation, of course) helps you lose weight and speeds up your metabolism. A few tablespoons a day is GOOD FOR YOU!<br /><br />My only con for this product is the plastic jar/tub. I hate plastic. Glass would be nice, as always!"

I made the mistake of just rinsing it out instead of following with another shampoo. Don't do this unless you want grease head! So, the next time I did the same thing, shampoo my hair first apply the coconut oil and allow it to sit for a while, but this time I shampooed it out. Boy what a difference! My hair was soft, shiny and manageable for the rest of the week. I now use it about once a week as a deep conditioner. Great stuff and I'm glad that I found it."

She has sensitive, dry skin, and will get rashes on her legs.  I just rub this in and wah-lah!  No more itchy skin.  Not to mention, unlike so many other products, it is completely fine if she decides to go to lick-town on it.  It also smells amazing, so it isn't a big deal if she gets it on something.  I also have dry skin, so I will rub it on my elbows and massage it into my scalp.  After that, you can put it in recipes in place of butter in order to replace some bad fat with good fat.  I am all for a product that is multipurpose and very ecofriendly.  Anytime you can go natural, you definitely should.  Maybe it's just the glue-eating kid in me, but I think it's pretty awesome that I can eat my conditioner/lotion."

I use this on my hair exclusively, I am an African-American and have natural hair. I usually just ""seal"" my hair with this, which it's good for, but it can be greasy. I don't really know how to combat that, but it doesn't really have too much of a smell either, which is good b/c I don't know how I feel about the smell of coconut. The amount is quite enough for the price, but depending on how much you use it may not last as long as it looks like it will. Mine probably won't last too long, but I will definitely buy again."
368120,B003B3OOPA,A3BVN2QBNPBHCR,Lincoln,5,5,5,1346198400,Wow!  The best smelling and tasting coconut oil yet!,"I'm very strict with my diet. I eat only organic foods, practice CRON (calorie restriction with optimal nutrition), eat minimal carbs and lots of nutrients. I've tested 4 other brands of organic coconut oil -- Nutiva, Spectrum Naturals, and 2 small scale raw food companies. This one is easily the best so far.<br /><br />The aroma is wonderful and the texture is much fuller than the other brands. This coconut oil has fuller taste and less watered-down feeling than the other brands. So if you're looking for a good organic coconut oil, this is the one.<br /><br />Now for some quick facts about how amazingly healthy this stuff is:<br /><br />1) Medium chain fatty acids --> Digest very easily without requiring the gall bladder to do much. Great for people missing gallbladders and truly everyone.<br /><br />2) Converts to usable energy very quickly. A much more balanced and less manic energy than any carbohydrate (fructose, lactose, glucose, etc)<br /><br />3) Anti-viral, anti-parasitic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal. Keeps your digestive system very clean inside. Helps destroy candida and balance intestinal (probiotic) bacteria. Helps the immune system.<br /><br />4) Longer lasting energy without insulin levels being adversely affected. Fats are the cleanest burning energy for our body. Carbohydrates cause insulin levels to raise and crash, which is what creates the ""eat every 3 hours"" cravings that so many people this is hunger. Healthy fats, like this oil, will not affect insulin and give us much more stable energy that last longer in the body.<br /><br />5) Tastes great. Smells great.<br /><br />6) Can be used topically to make the skin very soft. Is absorbed into the skin to nourish it, unlike most cosmetic moisturizers which leave residue or cause long-term dryness by unbalancing the body's innate skin oil balance.<br /><br />7) Can be used as a sexual lubricant. Coconut oil is a natural anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial lubricant which helps keep these organs clean and reduce the spread of unwanted problem.<br /><br />8) Great for hair and can be used as a leave-on conditioner. Like it's skin use, coconut oil will not imbalance the body's natural oils.... unlike chemical-based conditioners. Plus, because coconut is anti-""everything bad"" it will keep the hair clean too!<br /><br />9) Coconut oil detox cleanse. The medium-chain fatty acids make this and ideal food for detox cleanses because the energy is available with minimal digestive effort, plus all of it's anti-""everything bad"" properties. The detox cleanse is a 3 to 7 day process where all carbohydrate foods are removed and coconut oil is eaten as the primary energy source (approx. 14 Tablespoons each day). The oil can be combined with organic lemon water as well. You can find the instructions by Googling ""Natural News Coconut Oil Cleanse"".<br /><br />Basically, coconut oil is amazing! And this brand is the best I've found so far. Enjoy!<br /><br />*** Update: I found a good website for coconut oil information and recipes. It has summaries of many studies on coconut oil.  Visit coconutdiet (dotcom)"

I prefer the product in its solid state rather than the liquified state for use.<br /><br />Add a few drops to your lotion, use in your co-wash bottles and great when grilling foil wrapped seafoods and brush on shish kebabs and grilled veggies.

I haven't tried it internally yet, but the external use has been amazing.  I have keratosis pilaris (chicken skin) on my arms (upper and lower), legs, and butt (yay, me!).  I've only ever found one cream by Lush that made any difference, and it was very expensive.  Enter, coconut oil! First, you will notice that it comes as a solid (unless the temperature is above 72 degrees, then it melts, which is ok, don't panic).  You take a bit and rub it between your hands and it melts instantly.  You're going to think first: oh yuck, I'm not putting this on my body! But please do: rub it anywhere and everywhere.  You'll notice how at firstit doesn't seem to be sinking in, but if you wait about ten minutes, it will do just that.<br /><br />I should also mention I have a sensitive skin on my face, which despite proper exfoliating, sheds skin often.  I get dry patches that, when at their worst, act like burns that open and are painful.  I know, pretty gross.  I'm usually cautious about trying new products on my face because it's so sensitive.  For years I've been using Eucerin, but it's not always enough.<br /><br />I through caution to the wind and slatered my face with the coconut oil.  It felt pretty gross at first, but within ten minutes it started to sink it.  I was nervous that I would wake up in the morning with oil-induced acne, but that didn't happen.  What did happens was that it had sunk in completely and my face was the smoothest and softest I'd ever seen.  Honestly, I couldn't stop touching my face!  Of course this meant my makeup went on better, and I looked...I don't know...I guess the word is well-rested.<br /><br />Another HUGE bonus is that while the dots on my arms still look like they're there, my keratosis pilaris is all but gone!  My arms, legs, (and yes, butt) are the softest and smoothest I've ever seen them.  I can't believe this worked! As you're working the oil into your skin, don't forget to rub it into your nails and eyelashes too.  I swear my eyelashes look longer andI know my nails are definitely stronger.<br /><br />Lastly, this product is CHEAP, you really can't go wrong with it.  I have two tubs of it, one for my body and the other for my diet (the thought of using one for both grossed me out). I'll let you know how that goes.<br /><br />Anyway, consider this a five-star, two thumbs way up review!"

Coconut oil in general is amazing!  It has cleared up about 90% of my hormonal acne and after I wash my face and use the coconut oil, my face looks so healthy, glowing, and clean.  It seems to go against all sound advice to slather oil on your face, but it really works!  My husband even uses it each night after washing, and I've really noticed a change in his skin.  I have recently been using it on my entire body and have such soft skin (elbows and knees included).<br /><br />For this particular brand of coconut oil, it doesn't seem to be much different than the sample my sister gave me (which was a different brand).  There is a good bit in the jar.  It's pretty firm, so it's a little hard to dig out at first; but once your hands warm it up a little, it softens.  I dig out a small chunk and rub it between my palms.  It melts almost instantly and is ready to rub in.  This just seems to be the right way to take care of your skin as opposed to layering chemical after chemical in hopes that something, anything will work."

I also use it for cooking (great to add to shrimp or anything you want to infuse with a little coconut essence'. Would absolutely go with this brand again."

I wrap my hair at night in my satin head wrap and unwrap non-greasy, extremely lustrous, well moisturized.  I am African American and naturally have dry relaxed hair, but using this routine bi-weekly, I have hair that does not sound powerfully like snapping twigs when I press it between my fingers near my ears listening for dryness.

When I started this Coconut Oil regimen my blood pressure was 188/92 with medication. Last week it registered 125/75 without medication.  Needless to say I am tickled at the results since deciding to take control of my health naturally and stop relying upon doctors and drugs.

368128,B003B3OOPA,AB4XGHZNQN413,Bemirry,7,8,5,1326067200,Don't need my eczema medication anymore,"I've mostly used this coconut oil consistently on my skin for a month now. I have eczema and dry skin spots on my torso.<br /><br />So here's my review and my experience... a rant, and advice, I guess.<br /><br />You have to be pretty consistent with this stuff to see results -- if you're starting out with it, I think. I've been using this for a month at least 2 times a day, and it's in the middle of winter when my skin easily gets dry. I stopped using lotion after learning about its ineffectiveness and how it could be in fact harmful (carcinogenic from parabens and such) -- most of the conventional products anyway that we all find easily in our supermarkets.<br /><br />So I've learned that most health products they sell you don't really eliminate the problems at their roots -- mostly just symptoms, and in fact can contribute to cancer (make-up, shampoos, conditioners, lotions, laundry detergent...) This is a very clever business technique, because the customers will always be coming back for more toxic products that eliminate symptoms, but never completely eliminate the root of the customers' problems.<br /><br />I also learned that skin problems can not only be due to toxic chemicals from your conventional lotions, it can be from toxins that sit on the inside of your body from the junk food you've been ingesting -- this includes highly processed foods, toxic medications, the toxins your skin has absorbed over the years, and maybe even the polluted air you've been breathing.(I've been told by a nutritionist that many skin problems can be helped by colon cleansing and perhaps liver cleansing...).<br /><br />What I'm trying to say is that coconut oil can only do so much (at least, in my one month of experience) on the outside, it's helping just one factor out of many that would contribute to better skin health. But I'd say it's definitely better than using my prescribed topical medication which are basically steroids (betamethasone dipropionate I think). The doctor said not to use it for more than 10 days in a row (my medication), that it's bad that the skin absorbs it. *ahem* you know that doctors are not going to recommend anything other than drugs that are mostly toxic? my dermatologist was definitely giving me carcinogens, which I found out from my doctor -- so she started prescribing me steroids. that can't be good either now can it, especially when she told me that my skin shouldn't absorb too much of it?<br /><br />It's okay to absorb the coconut oil though, because it's non-toxic, nourishing for the skin, anti-fungal, anti-oxidant and can be used internally as well. So definitely, it's great for eczema. You have to be patient with it, though -- it's not harsh and strong like my steroid cream that works in minutes. The coconut oil on the first few applications within the first day or two will still leave your skin pretty dry (in my experience), but I think it's just a matter of your skin getting used to it or something. Or maybe it's a matter of getting it so that your skin is actually nourished, after all those years of using toxic malnourishing lotions.<br /><br />With acne, it's meh. I have acne on my forehead, and I learned that it's due to the oil from my hair... or, your forehead naturally produces more grease than other parts of the body. At least for me. I didn't see that big a difference with coconut oil in the past month, but I solved my acne on my forehead problem with a facial cleanse at a day spa, followed by applying organic jojoba oil on it day and night for almost a week now... and the acne's pretty much calmed down a lot.<br /><br />My face was really smooth when I consistently used the old lotions -- while I was switching to coconut oil for the first few weeks, my face was kind of dry. But now it's back to smooth, possibly even smoother.<br /><br />I bought another jar for my mom, just for general use. She used it on some sort of super itchy rash (possibly some sort of infection, I had no idea) that just wouldn't go away for months. In her experience, after applying coconut oil, her rash itched like crazy while it was greasy. But after a few days of application, it was getting better and itching less frequently. When she applied the coconut oil at night, it wouldn't wake her up anymore from the itchiness like it used to.<br /><br />I will continue to use organic extra virgin coconut oil, and stay away from toxic substances. I think I'm also going to start cooking with coconut oil as well.<br /><br />The only downside to coconut oil in my experience and/or from what I've read and researched, are:<br /><br />if you don't like the smell<br />if you're allergic<br />if you're too lazy/impatient to switch from conventional lotions to coconut oil<br /><br />Coconut oil is too good to be true. As a huge developed country we're so far removed that we had no idea that we don't really need drugs.  At least for good skin and hair and to slow the aging process, stick to organic extra virgin coconut oil. It's probably the only staple ""cosmetic"" product you'll ever need -- good health leads to beauty."
368129,B003B3OOPA,AMZ80S63DXM11,j. crow,7,8,5,1323302400,Love this stuff!,"This is the brand I usually purchase at the local co-op, and I am super stoked to see it here for half of what I normally pay so I just purchased two pounds. I can go through a pound in a month because I use it to make deodorant, toothpaste, to oil pull with, as a supplement, to cook with, and as body and hair moisturizer for me and my toddler. We both have very curly hair and dry skin and this is my favorite oil to use. It does have a somewhat strong scent that smells similar to buttered popcorn, haha, but I like it. No one has ever remarked that we smell bad. A few times I've been told we smell like pastry or coconut or ""something vaguely familiar"" and whenever I mention popcorn usually people agree. Anyways, I love this for first aid (rashes, cuts, burns) and to fend of sickness (often I can take a TBS and oil pull and feel better within an hour). Word of caution: take it easy if you are taking this internally at first. I've thrown up from taking too much on an empty stomach before (felt better immediately after, though). The die-off from bacteria can cause you to have ""detox sickness"". Oh! And it helps make breastmilk richer too. I really hope it will stay at this price long enough for me to make my next order.

Not only can you use it for cooking and baking (and even around the edges of bakeware or in a frying pan in place of olive oil), but you can also use it for personal care.<br /><br />To do so, I scoop some into a small container so I don't have to dip my fingers in the larger jar.  I keep the large jar in my kitchen for cooking purposes, and then small container in my bathroom, where I use it as an eye makeup remover when I have heavy makeup on, as a skin moisturizer, and as a hair treatment.  For the hair, a small amount rubbed/melted into your palms and smoothed on over hair helps with flyaways, and a larger amount rubbed in before bed or twenty minutes before washing serves as a deep treatment. (Oftentimes, I'll put it in my hair before I go workout so that the heat helps it penetrate.)  Since coconut oil is easily absorbed by the hair, it makes for a great conditioner.<br /><br />The Nature's Way brand has consistent quality and tastes very good. It's a staple item in our house."

I tryed it on a spoon, it has a suttle tast of an amond joy or mounds bar. Just a hint of chocolate and toasted nuts. I also use it on my hair to keep it moist since I just discovered the trend of natrual hair and hair styles for natural hair. I stopped the relxars in 1998 but was still hardheaded about the box braids etc. My stylest finally got me to understand that less is more.so for over 10 years it's just been wash consi and flat iron. I did have color put in a year ago and it's almost grown out. But I wanted to try something diffrent that I would'nt regret later. and the blow out braid out works very well for me.

For me I read the reviews first and then looked at the prices and checked afew other places ( okeay one ) but I can't say where. In the end I chose this Coconut oil made by natures way.

The oil sold at the stores isn't pure so I decided to buy this product on amazon. I have used 2 jars so far and I am in love with it! The oil comes in solid form and then turns into a liquid once you rub it between your palms. I warm the oil in a small container, then apply it to my hair, and leave it overnight to shampoo the next day. I also use this as a skin moisturizer in the winter. I don't use this on my face because my face is tends to be sensitive and flares up even with the most ""organic"" products. So if you are acne prone, then I would suggest testing it out before you apply it."

I did not really buy this for cooking but for hair and skin care and it melts on the skin like butter !!! I already love it, it smells wonderful and I will continue to use it, so that way I am able to stay away from paraben- containing hair care and skin care products. If they had even larger jars, I would order them !!! Eventually I will order more even for cooking. I really would recommend this, if you have really curly hair to use it in place of hair grease. It will even last longer and it is much cheaper, cleaner and healthier in the longrun !!!<br />I recommend this product to anyone who wants to use it what natuer already has to offer."

I have used it for cooking, broiling, eating by the spoonful and as a skin moisturizer and massage oil.<br />Last night I put a few pats of this coconut oil on salmon with a salt and herb mix.  I broiled the salmon and it tasted amazing.  The coconut oil definitely enhanced the flavor.<br />I have been using this oil for frying eggs as well.  It does not seem to burn as quickly as olive oil or butter and it also seems that less is needed for frying - probably since it's easier to use small amounts since it is in solid form.<br />This coconut oil also worked well for sauteing tofu and broccoli with Bragg's liquid unfermented soy.<br />It's also tasty on a baked potato and I find that I can skip the salt and still enjoy the flavor.  You can also add it to rice or rice and beans or french fries for a tropical splash of flavor.<br />I combined this coconut oil with olive oil to saute vegetables for a pasta dish and it worked beautifully.<br />It has mild, fresh flavor and a little seems to go a long way.<br /><br />April 19, 2012<br /><br />Still loving this coconut oil.  It tastes great so you could literally eat a spoonful or two if you were hungry and needed instant energy.<br />I packed it for a trip to Florida.  It was solid when I arrived, but liquified once I hit the warmer weather.<br />It also works great in a hot bath for instant moisturizing and it's the perfect after sun moisturizer.  It smells so good that you could use it as a very mild perfume and moisturizer just by rubbing it into your arms and legs until the oil is absorbed - seriously!"

I have been using a small amount in my hair after I wash and towel-dry my hair for the past 3 weeks, and my normally fine, dry hair is noticeably healthier.  It's not as frizzy and dry.  The coconut oil is actually changing my hair condition instead of just sitting on the surface of my hair and making it look glossy.<br /><br />I have tried some pretty expensive products in my hair ($20-$30 conditioners, hot oil treatments, etc.), and all I can say is, I am never going back.  My advice is to be patient with it, it's not an overnight cure, but your hair will definitely feel great over time.<br /><br />I also have pretty dry skin, but the oil seems to provide only minimal moisture for my cracked skin.  I'm sure it's great for normal skin, though."

(Delicious!) And again, didn't feel the need to snack later in the evening.<br /><br />Each cookie is individually packaged, and their texture is soft and moist, with just the right amount of sweetness. Natural flavors used in the making are Cinnamon and All Spice.  These flavorings give the cookies a real old-fashioned, homemade taste.<br /><br />Nutritionally, the cookies have 170 calories each, 1.5g saturated fat, 150 mg sodium, and 12g sugar. They also have 2g of protein, and contain 25g of fiber.<br /><br />While the calorie count may seem a bit high for one cookie, they are good sized, and 1 cookie per serving is certainly enough to satisfy.<br /><br />Because of their great taste and texture, kids will probably enjoy them also.<br /><br />If you like oatmeal raisin cookies, give these a try!"

Make a double batch and freeze the dough before baking and you wouldn't have to do this every week to have enough cookies to last entire month or longer.  You'll build bonding moments, create less waste, teach simple mathematics and cooking skills, and provide a far healthier snack option for your child(ren).<br /><br />And if you truly don't have the time to bake cookies, then buy some fresh fruit.  If nothing else, you'll have fewer additives and most fruit comes in it's own convenient packaging."

They are not delicious.  Considering they're 170 calories for ONE cookie you'd expect something decadent.  It's not even as tasty as an average cookie.<br /><br />A little bit dry considering it's supposed to be soft, moist cookie.  A slight sandy or grainy texture.  There's nothing foul or obnoxious about the taste - it's just nothing special.<br /><br />Nutritionally - ok for a cookie.  170 calories, 1.5g sat fat.  4g fiber!  (quite a bit.)  But I don't look at a cookie as some sort of health food.  A big* cookie like this should be an indulgence - a treat.  Instead it's not abhorrent.  If you start eating this, you'll finish it.  But you won't go out of your way for another one.<br /><br />*not THAT big.  It's not like a famous amos or something."

The major positive is that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour.  Other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet, individually wrapped, and it is soft, but not crumbly.  My husband and I tried these cookies for dessert last night.  The first issue was that they are 170 calories each, meaning we only had one, even though their size is not particularly large, around 3 inches in diameter.  Second, the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made; it will not remotely remind you of homemade.  Third, and personally, there are not enough raisins.  Finally, both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring, which was border line too much; the ingredients list indicates allspice as well.  The only ""fortifications"" to the cookie are calcium (4%) and iron (8%)."

Each of the six cookies is enclosed in a sturdy plastic envelope, with a tooth-edge at the top and bottom, suitable for grasping and for tearing open the envelope.  On the plus side, all of the cookies were intact, despite shipping.  The intact nature of the cookies was largely due to the fact that they are soft (not crunchy) and secondarily due to the secure packaging.  The cookies were bland and unadventuresome, both in taste and in texture.  Although the photographs on the cardboard box and on the plastic envelope show cookies having a surface dotted withabout 12 whole raisins, it was the case that the actual cookie contains a scattering of chopped raisin bits inside.  Therefore, the consumer should not expect to be treated to a cookies bearing a cargo of plump, juicy raisins.  In paying attention to the flavor, I noticed that the cookies had a detectable raisin flavor.  Also on the plus side, in knowing (from first-hand experience) that hard oatmeal can get wedged in between fillings, resulting in damage to teeth and fillings, the older consumer will be pleased that this QUAKER product is totally inocuous, as far as dental work is concerned.  These cookies are, indeed, sooooooft!<br /><br />Ordinary oatmeal has about 61 grams carbohydrate, 12 grams protein, and 7 grams fat, per 100 grams of oatmeal (Pomeranz (1987) Modern Cereal Science and Technology (pages 350-370)).  The NUTRITION FACTS label that this QUAKER product shows that the breakdown is as follows.  Each QUAKER cookie (42 grams) contains 27 grams carbohydrate, 6 grams of fat, and only 2 grams of protein.  Hence, it can be seen, that the cookies, as compared to straight oatmeal, is somewhat low in protein.  The low protein content should not be a concern to most adults, because growth, and the issue of acquiring the proper nutrient balance to sustain growth, is generally relevant only during pregnancy and lactation, and for growing children.  If any conclusion can be made regarding this fine product, is that it could be a preferred snack food for adults who have had multiple dental fillings, and need to worry about dental damage.  Although this cookie is fine for children, please remember that much better sources of protein are available, e.g., milk, cheese, meat, fish, poultry, tofu, and legumes (peas, beans, lentils)."

It was indeed soft, but it didn't seem artificially so, more like it was just cooled down from the oven.<br /><br />As I began my 'taste test', I appreciated the fact that the cookies are individually wrapped, which allows for easy transport in lunches or purses.  I took a small bite at first, because I was already prepared to be disappointed.  As that bite went down, I reached for another.  Then another.  Very tasty, as it turned out!  Soon the cookie was gone and I realized I wanted another one!  However, at 170 calories each, these are NOT ""low calorie"", they're just made with better ingredients than most.<br /><br />As for other nutrition information (other than the fiber and calorie count mentioned above), each cookie has 150 milligrams of sodium, so not too bad there.  You'll find 4% of calcium and 8% of iron (recommended daily requirements).<br /><br />The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Sugar is about number 10 or so on the ingredient list.  One quibble I have is that the list of ingredients is rather lengthy.  My nutritionist has advised me to watch for products with what seem like extraordinarily long ingredient lists, probably means there's lots of stuff in there that's not exactly ""good"" for us, but it is what it is:  a factory-made, store-bought cookie that's got a pretty long list of ingredients and shelf life that don't come naturally to ""homemade cookies"".  Just accept it for what it is, a decent, convenient mass-produced cookie."

563079,B007JFMH8M,A3H7AOFQDPU0JV,"Timothy Capehart ""Review-a-holic""",1,1,4,1343865600,Pretty durn good cookie.,"Taste: I thought these did a good job of mimicking the taste of home made cookies. Cinnamony and raisiny (though the raisins aren't big plump raisins...they're more suggestions of raisins...and they are sweetened by sugar and fructose NOT HFCS.<br /><br />Mouth feel: When Mom makes oatmeal cookies, you can feel the oat meal (usually) when you are chewing. This doesn't have that. The oats are milled to the point where the flavour is there but the texture is not. If this is a problem for you, you might want to pass. Other than that, it's probably a good idea to have a glass of milk handy. They are ""moist"" in that they aren't crunchy...but they verge on dry.<br /><br />Value: On Amazon, the cookies come to about .50$ a piece. Which is comparable to my local grocery.<br /><br />A good all around (large) cookie and I think I will try the other varieties...you should too!"

The cookies are individually packed, which makes it easy to grab for lunches, or to throw in a purse or backback for ""on the go"" kids.  The cookies are fairly good sized, and packed with raisins.  I was concerned about an aftertaste that I have sometimes noticed with cookies that are pre-packaged (maybe a preservative that is often used?) but I did not notice any funny taste or smell to these cookies.  In fact, I could not find anything I was unhappy with!"
563081,B007JFMH8M,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,Enjolras,0,0,5,1343088000,Strong cinnamon spice,"Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite. Quaker Oats has done these well with this new product. The strongest flavor to come off is, perhaps surprisingly, cinnamon. It's a very strong taste at the tip of your tongue. The cookie also does have enough raisins for it to qualify as oatmeal raisin, which was something I was concerned about at first.<br /><br />The cookie is very soft and still tastes pretty fresh, even after all the packing and processing that obviously went into it. They're about as big as you'd imagine it to be from the picture on the box, which is actually impressive given how often cookies end up being smaller than they appear. Overall, this is a good choice if you want cheap, store-bought oatmeal cookies."

Thanks to Quaker and Influenster for introducing me to this product!"
563083,B007JFMH8M,A3QD59N3M7O7KB,Xina143,0,0,4,1343088000,"Good, Portable Snack","Quick breakdown of the cost.  For $34.71 you got 12 boxes of 6 cookies.  That's about $2.90 a box, and 49 cents per cookie.  NOT too bad.<br /><br />Taste-This is a denser cookie than I usually enjoy, especially when it comes to my oatmeal raisin.  (My favorite cookie, by the way!)  It almost has a cake like consistency, and while it isn't the type of cookie I would munch on at home while I watch a Blu-Ray, this is the type of snack I would buy for road trips or picnics.  There is a hint of brown sugar, not overwhelming, but enough that my little ones (8 and 4) remarked that they liked the sweetness of it.  My oldest, wished there were more raisins, and I would have to agree with that as well.  But I liked the whole grains. Overall, it is good, but a bit dry.<br /><br />Size-this is a larger cookie, similar to what you would get in say Subway or Starbucks.  Not overly huge, but not too small either.  I think this is a perfect snack size.<br /><br />Nutrition-at 170 calories it isn't a lightweight, but nor is it overly fattening either.  6 Grams of fat, 1.5 grams of Saturated (NOT horrific), but it has some Polyunsaturated and 3.5 grams of Monounsaturated=the 'good' kind of fat.  4 grams of fiber, good in a snack like this, but only 2 grams a protein, wish there was more.<br /><br />All in all, this isn't a snack I would buy on a regular basis.  Maybe once in awhile for school lunches, and I would certainly get this for a road trip, or a hike.  Compared to many other snacks like this, it is a decent value for the money, and if you enjoy a thicker cookie, this is right up your alley!"

The quality and taste are very much the same as Archway brand; that is a good thing as I consider them to be the best store-bought cookie out there.  My husband would have liked more whole oats in the mix, but understands that too few people appreciate texture in their food.<br /><br />The individual wrapping might be nice for kids' lunches but is an expensive and unecological waste for the (typical) case that a group will be eating them and/or individuals will eat more than one.  At the very, very, least wrap them two-at-a time?<br /><br />If they're priced similarly to Archway, I would expect them to do at least as well as the equivalent Archway cookies."

They need to be a little more moist, especially since the whole point of cookies in individual foil wrappers is to protect moisture. The taste is traditional cinnamon raisin, and the taste is fine, but in this crowded market, with many competitors, Quaker cannot afford for the cookies not to be perfectly moist.<br /><br />I remember back when the Quaker Oats came in a round, cardboard container. On the side of that container was a recipe for oatmeal cookies, which my mom used to make frequently. Those cookies, with Nestle's chocolate chips added, were the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I ever tasted. Now, if Quaker could market those cookies and make 'em taste as good as mom's, then they'd have something."

They are pretty bland, just a mild raisiny sweetness and the texture is dry and crumbly and turns a little mealy upon chewing.  I tried them in coffee and in milk to see if they were better that way and while the taste was a little better the texture just became wet and mealy and bits fell off into my coffee.  A soft cookie can definitely be moist, hold up to milk and have a bit of chew to it.  Pepperidge Farm makes an addictive soft baked oatmeal cookie."

These cookies taste fine, but they are pretty dry and fairly crumbly. Not overly enjoyable. They'd be fine dunked in milk or something, but I'd be afraid half of it would fall into the glass. Little Debbie and Pepperidge Farms have both proven that you can sell packaged, soft-baked cookies that are still moist. Plus, these seem over-packaged. Individually wrapped cookies? Okay, yeah it's handy for a packed lunch or something, but really? That seems excessive. I'd probably skip these."

I'm already a huge fan of almost all Quaker products, and these cookies didn't disappoint. They're SUPER soft, and weren't dry whatsoever!!! The oatmeal cookie part has a great flavor, no weird aftertaste like some cookies do. The raisins were decent, nice and plump, juicy, didn't have the dried out look, and there were enough of them in the cookies, but not too many (meaning the kids will still eat them, lol). They were good sized cookies, individually wrapped to ensure freshness, and had a delicious taste. Now I'm craving them! Overall, they were a great cookie! I'd definitely purchase them again. Can't wait til they're back in stock on Amazon!"

Such a healthier way to enjoy cookies.

563291,B007JFMH8M,A3IMO49QD6OYKN,D. A. Ross,1,1,4,1343088000,Guilty pleasure or guiltless treat?,"Let's be honest: there are few desserts that can compete with a fresh baked, chewy oatmeal cookie. Even better when it's oatmeal raisin! As such, I was somewhat skeptical of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies, as I'm generally let down by store-bought cookies. Well, I'm here to tell you, I have become a believer. I have seen the light! Here's a breakdown of what I think overall:<br /><br />TEXTURE:<br />The package says ""soft-baked,"" and brother, it is no lie. These cookies are soft, moist and chewy, thus negating the need to do the milk dunk. Though, ice cold milk is a requisite with cookies, regardless.<br /><br />SERVING SIZE:<br />At 42g, these cookies are pretty well-sized and will definitely satisfy even the hardiest of sugar seekers. It would take 3 Oreos to match the size of one oatmeal raisin. No contest.<br /><br />TASTE:<br />Dynamite. Sweet cinnamon and raisins definitely prevail in this recipe, giving the oatmeal an authentic, homemade flavor.<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL PROFILE:<br />Now, this is where Quaker loses a few points with me. Though certainly not the unhealthiest cookie out there (in fact, it's probably on the healthier end of the spectrum), there are a few select ingredients that could be avoided, such as corn syrup. But, each cookie does contain 4g of fiber, as well as several grams of healthy fats, and 2g protein! For those who are curious, here's the complete nutrient breakdown:<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 Cookie (42g)<br />Calories: 140<br />Total Fat: 6g (9%)<br />Saturated Fat: 1.5g (8%)<br />Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g<br />Monounsaturated Fat: 3.5g<br />Cholesterol: 15mg (5%)<br />Sodium: 150mg (6%)<br />Total Carbohydrate: 27g (9%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 4g (16%)<br />Sugars: 12g<br />Other Carbohydrate: 11g<br />Protein: 2g<br /><br />Ingredients: Whole Grain Oat Flour, Enriched Flour (Bleached and Unbleached Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Raisins, Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Whole Wheat Flour, Palm and High Oleic Canola Oil (with TBHQ [preservative]), Fructose, Invert Sugar Syrup, Mid-Oleic Sunflower Oil, Raisin Paste, Inulin, Granola (Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil*, Honey, Brown Sugar Molasses), Dried Eggs, Modified Corn Starch, Corn Syrup, Polydextrose, Leavening Agents (Sodium Bicarbonate, Ammonium Bicarbonate), Oat Fiber, Propylene Glycol Mono- and Diesters of Fat and Fatty Acids, Mono- and Diglycerides, Soy Lecithin, BHT [to preserve freshness], Citric Acid [to preserve freshness], Wheat Gluten, Molasses, Calcium Phosphate, Salt, Natural Flavor, Cinnamon, Allspice, Corn Starch, Enzymes. *Adds a Dietarily Insignificant Amount of Trans Fat<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />Stellar! Each cookie is individually wrapped for easy travel and consumption, so parents can toss one in their kid's lunch box, or tote one to the office for an easy snack/dessert.<br /><br />COST:<br />From what I can tell, the Quaker cookies are about par for the course in terms of cost, neither on the high nor low end, making for a pretty economical choice. Based on Amazon's pricing as I write this, the cost is slightly less than $1.00 per cookie. Not bad!<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />If you're looking to indulge in something sweet, somewhat healthy, and reminds you of a homemade treat, you can't do much better than Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies. The only challenge will be trying to resist a second helping, especially if you still have ice cold milk remaining in your glass."
563292,B007JFMH8M,A23RZIU0N8K2KR,M. Caceres,1,1,5,1343088000,Great to take to the office or for kids to take to school!,"My box has an expiration date of September 13, 2012, which is a little bit less than 2 months (which is okay, because the cookies get eaten up fast!). The cookies, made with whole grain Quaker oats, are definitely soft baked, and you can taste the delicious oatmeal in every bite! My only criticism of these cookies is that even though they had raisins, I couldn't taste them! It was practically just an oatmeal taste.<br /><br />Each cookie's size is a bit larger the palm of an adult hand. I love that they are individually wrapped because it means I can take them on the go with me! Each cookie is 170 calories, has 1.5 gram of fat, 150mg of sodium, and 12gram of sugar. I don't recommend the cookies for warding off hunger if you are on a diet as the calories per cookie is pretty high. This is good as treats for children's lunches though or to have them in your car when ever you go hungry.<br /><br />Also, I dropped one of the cookies (still in the wrapper) on the floor and it did not crumble, which I was happy with."

There's nothing like bring in the middle of the ravenousness of pregnancy and being told to watch what you eat. But it did get me to start paying better attention to how I could still enjoy foods I loved while making healthier choices. One of the things I learned to balance was fiber intake. Ever since I've made a point to always go for whole grains when the choice is available and Quaker's products tend to make the best of combining deliciousness with heart-healthy oats.<br /><br />I recently received a sample of these Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster and they're surprisingly good. Maybe not quite as good as the ones my mom made when I was a kid but still a tasty treat reminiscent of the childhood classic. Packed with raisins and big enough you only need one they're a satisfying snack or dessert option. Since traditional oatmeal cookies aren't my favorite I'm going to have to try one of their other flavors like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH96"">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMHBE"">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Cranberry and Yogurt, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>.

My 3 year old son loved the cookie - each cookie is pretty large, very soft and full of raisins. If you buy a package of 6, they are individually wrapped which is great for travel. It is great that they are made with whole grain Quaker oats - and that they have a nice helping of raisins. They are still a cookie though and have 12 grams of sugar per cookie. I did buy a box for my son for an occasional treat."

So I was happy to see that the cookie didn't have too many raisins in it but enough to get some in every bite and still be able to taste the cookie. Most oatmeal cookies leave a thick,dry feeling in your mouth but nothing like that with this one, perhaps because it was so soft and chewy. They are on my list to buy again. The cookie was super soft, great for my 1 year old to eat. It was also big enough that I could split it between both kids. I would suggest these to anyone looking for a delicious cookie."

These soft oatmeal raisin cookies are actually quite good. Each cookie weighs about 1.48 ounces, and is about 170 calories (27 grams of carbohydrates). So, while they are not exactly a low-calorie snack, they aren't too bad either.<br /><br />The nice thing about them is that they are nicely filling, making them a nice afternoon snack, when you need a little something to get you through work. And, while oatmeal raisin cookies are not my favorite snack, I did find these to be quite good.

Well they have been trying to expand from just the basic oatmeal for some time. These soft cookies are tasty and satisfying. In my family you can tell how good they are by how quickly they disappear. Weel - they disappeared in swift order. In fact I barely got to taste more than one. The general consensus is these are 'just like homemade. There is not greater compliment that can be paid.

That's probably because my wife makes such awesome chocolate cookies.  When I do get an opportunity to try an oatmeal and raisin cookie it is usually from a store-bought package.  I usually come away impressed with how moist these pre-packaged cookies are.  That's what surprised me most about Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie;  They're soft but they aren't moist.  There is a distinct soft dryness to the cookies. The taste was good and my grand daughter quickly ate up most of them.  She liked them because they are tasty and soft.  I agree and I guess two out of three criteria is good but I was looking for one more quality

I couldn't get mine to try more than one bite. Even as an oatmeal cookie, they aren't that good. We found them salty and bland. Yes they were soft, but also crumbly, which made a mess. I wouldn't say they are the worst I've ever tried, be definitely not as good as other Quaker products."

And it is defintely enough for a snack - at 1.48 oz and 170 calories - that's plenty. The raisins, too were outstanding. But the cookie itself was not great tasting.

And even though they are soft, they are firm enough they do not crumble in your hand.  And there is enough raisins you will have at least one or more in every bite.

The cookies were very soft and tasty.  Each cookie was full of raisins, and still retained an ""oatmeal"" taste.  They are sized perfectly, one cookie is big enough to satisfy a craving without eating half of the box.  My only complaint is that they were crumbly.  This was fine for my 17 month old twins, as they still don't have all of their teeth, and have trouble biting and chewing hard cookies.  I had a problem with the crumbly texture, because when I tried to dip the cookie into a glass of milk, a big chunk of it broke off and fell to the bottom of the glass, where it turned into inedible mush.

They are very well packaged, so I don't think that was the problem. Maybe they're made that way. But I've also heard that some products aren't great to order by mail in hot summer months, as they may dry out. I know mine probably spent at least a few hours on the porch in 90 degree weather.

Just 2 of these cookies gives you that satisfying full feeling. Since it is made out of oatmeal and raisins, we could classify it as a healthy snack. But on the nutritional breakdown, would be better if this snack would go down on a less than 5mg cholesterol. The per serving content of cholesterol is 15mg, sugar is 12g, so as with any other food, moderation is the key. Nevertheless, anything oatmeal gives you a great start on eating, whether to maintain a healthy lifestyle or starting one."

The individual cookies weren't huge but they were big and chewy enough to satisfy a sweet tooth with just one package. They weren't overly sweet or overloaded with raisins--someone must have studied the cookie-to-raisin ratio and came up with the perfect number. I'll definitely much on these again."

There is a sense of artificiality about the flavor that may come from preservatives or flavoring additives. My family ate all the samples we received, but there was no real drive to go out and buy a box, even among my otherwise enthusiastic cookie-eating teens.  I think that the product needs a trip back to the drawing board if the goal is authentic oatmeal cookie taste and not just texture.  Sorry!"

I have always been someone that sticks to either cheaper brands, or the kind of cookies that are made in a markets own bakery.  Personally I think the latter are the best there is in most cases as far as store bought is concerned..  As for these Quaker cookies I found them to be just average in taste.  The box I got held very fresh cookies individually wrapped that were satisfying in flavor, but not at all anything special.  Personally I don't think the heavier cost of these are worth it for just being a famous brand.  You can do at least just as good with other store bought brands, and much better in my opinion in buying your local markets cookies.  On the other hand if you happen to be a big fan Quaker Oats cookies, or just enjoy the particular flavor of these, buying them here in the big 12 pack is not a bad deal at all.  The cost is enough to get you the free shipping, and the convenience along with the reasonable price makes it a sold deal.  Enjoy if these are your favor.. : )"

Oatmeal cookies are one of my favorites so I gave these a try.<br /><br />The packaging is fine but the cookie does not have a very good taste. It has a dry texture to it, not very oat-like at all. They are soft, but not moist. There were plenty of raisens but not enough spice for my taste.

The promised raisins are mostly small bits of chopped raisins and don't really add to the flavor of the cookie. I would have like whole raisins. The taste is mostly oatmeal with just the right amount of cinnamon. They are also dry. You really need an accompanying beverage with these. They are hearty enough that one makes a good snack.<br /><br />While I would never mistake these for Mom's oatmeal cookies (or mine for that matter) they're not too bad for ""store-bought.""

A little on the bland side, but the good side of the bland side, if there is such a thing. They are a nice sized cookie...bigger than other packaged cookies that come in the plastic trays. They have the perfect amount of raisins in them - not over packed, but just enough. I guess I expected them to be more ""oatmealy"" since they are from Quaker, after all. They have the oatmeal raisin cookie flavor going on, but not the texture.<br /><br />The complaint that I have with them is that they are SO very dry. You will definitely want to have a big glass of milk handy. That itself was another problem for me - I don't drink milk. I just don't like it. Yes, it is a personal problem, not a fault of Quaker of course, but what else do you drink with cookies? Nothing else seems to go quite right with cookies. I do like to dunk cookies in milk, but these Oatmeal Raisin cookies are not a good choice for that because they would get mushy and fall apart right away.<br /><br />I can't say that i'd buy these.

But don't expect a lot of home-baked flavor, or even the kind of moist chewiness you think of when you think of an oatmeal cookie because it's simply not there.<br /><br />I can't really recommend them, but I can't entirely dismiss them either.  Consider them stop-gap and buy accordingly."

My grandma makes the best oatmeal raisin cookies and a lady at church makes the second best. However, I'm always willing to try someone else's oatmeal raisin cookies. Recently, Quaker started selling these SOFT-BAKED OATMEAL COOKIE WITH RAISINS. The cookies themselves aren't too bad. They're better than the usual store-bought oatmeal cookie. They're soft and chewy with a slightly sweet aftertaste. However, there's nothing that really distinguishes them either. There are 6 cookies in a box. They are good cookies that make a nice after lunch dessert or an in between snack."

I have many fond memories of enjoying making cookies straight out of the Quaker oat box, enjoying them after-school or having them packed in my school lunchbag. When I saw these were available to test, I was naturally excited, I've always loved Quaker oats and they make a quality product. Always.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found these cookies to be remarkably bland and quite plain. They aren't sweet enough for my particular taste, nor are they remarkable in any way. Sure they have whole grain. But they taste too bland for me, and are indeed quite plain. No one in my family liked them. They were just completely generic. For me, they needed more cinnamon and sugar and vanilla for my taste preference.<br /><br />There are 6 individual cookies sealed in tiny packs, making them useful for travel/lunches."

However, these failed miserably in my mind - each individual cookie has 12g of sugar, yet there is a dry, bland taste. Combined with the fact that there are 170 calories, 6 grams of fat and 150 mg of sodium in each cookie, it's hardly worth eating if you don't even enjoy the taste!"

The bad points are that they don't have all that much flavor.  They also have a heavier consistency than what I would prefer.  These cookies would benefit from more of the kinds of spices that can make cookies tasty- cinnamon, nutmeg, and whatnot.  I'd be willing to try these in a chocolate chip or other chocolate version, as the chocolate would add some flavor value, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat these again."

The oatmeal flavor for the cookie is just as it should be.  When first opening the packet the aroma hinted at maybe a pinch of cinnamon added or maybe nutmeg in the mix.<br /><br />The consistency though was spongy, and rather dry.

Most cookies labeled ""oatmeal"" have enriched white flour as their main ingredient.  These cookies also have a generous amount of juicy raisins, not the dried out raisins found in some other brands.<br /><br />I did find the cookies a bit too sweet for my taste, especially on the first bite.  The sweetness was much less strong after that first bite. There is a natural grain aftertaste that I found pleasant but others may not.  Also, I found the cookies a bit too crumbly when the individual packs are first opened. I found that if I let the opened package sit in a sealed contained for a day or two the texture was more to my liking.<br /><br />I liked the individual packages so that you can eat just one without the rest going stale.  I also liked that the ingredient list is on each package; this is very important for those with food allergies if the box is not available.<br /><br />All in all though these are a good treat. Very enjoyable.  I would give it 3.5 stars if that rating were possible."

These come in single packs of mid-sized cookies (.73 oz. each), so I suppose it can help with portion control.  However, at 170 calories, it's pretty high for those needing to lose weight.  It only contains 2g of protein.  It also contains 12g of sugar, so I wouldn't call this a friendly treat for those people battling diabetes or who are borderline diabetics.  The ingredients are in very tiny print, in a box that is over 1.5 inches in length, & contains loads of ingredients I can barely pronounce & have no idea what they are.  It's is kinda soft & tastes okay; but it's not a cookie a foodie like myself gushes over."

The individually wrapped cookies make them great to pack in lunches or keep in the car for an afternoon snack.

I thought they tasted good, but I found them to be a little on the dry side.  A lot of packaged cookies have an odd chemical aftertaste, but I didn't really notice much with these.<br /><br />However, I would like to see better choices on ingredients.  First, I don't understand the need for both bleached and unbleached flour.  Quaker should just stick with unbleached.  Second, I accept sugar as an ingredient.  These are cookies.  Cookies are sweet, and I expect sugar.  Yet why do they also have to use fructose, invert sugar syrup, corn syrup, and polydextrose?  These also contain molasses, which are a natural sweetener.  Finally, these have both corn starch and modified corn starch.  Again, why?  You may find other ingredients that you would question, but these seemed like the glaring issues to me.  In the end, I think this is too much to overcome when you combine it with a relatively high percentage (60 out of 170) of calories from fat.  In short, I cannot recommend these cookies."

I had not done any rsearch on them previously but remembered the oatmeal cookies my grandmother baked and how tasty they were. I was anxious to try out the Quaker version. When the box arrived the first thing I noticed, right on the front of the box, was that each of the six individually wrapped cookies contains a whopping 170 calories. When I was a super active kid I ate my grandmother's cookies with impunity although I did not know the calorie count. I was always a skinny kid regardless of what I ate. Now, as an adult, I am no longer skinny but not a lard butt either and I do not aspire to become one by eating these cookies. However, I wanted to do a taste test so I took a bite and quickly realized that these are simply run of the mill oatmeal cookies. They have no distinguishing characteristics other than the major calorie count. Dry, stale and tasteless are the best descriptions I can come up with."

I had rather high expectations since I generally like Quaker products, and my family eats a lot of their chewy granola bars. These cookies are quite disappointing. They are soft, but they are also very dry. The raisins are totally desiccated and not even chewy because they are so dry and shriveled. The cookies themselves have a dry, rather powdery texture. At 170 calories per cookie, I plan to stick with Quaker's chewy granola bars which taste much better and are in the 90-110 calorie range."

The feeling of being a simple cookie are worth their while. My only gripes about them is that their only 6 in a package so if you really are a heavy cookie snacker, you'll be a bit dissapointed. Also, there aren't that many in a package compared to the amount there are in a box from Little Debbie or other brands of cookies.

They are not too bad when it comes to nutrition either - each one of them is just 170 calories. The only downside for me about these cookies is that they seem to be a bit too crumbly, and not gooey enough.

This is the high point. It goes down hill from there.<br /><br />Let me start with the taste. It is average at best, it is soft, but very cardboardy in taste which makes the sweetness of the raisins stand out even more. Often times with food, the trade-offs are great taste with bad nutrition versus average/bad taste with good nutrition. This one has both average/bad taste and bad nutrition. So what's the point of eating not-very-tasty junk food?<br /><br />Because let's face it, that's what this is. The list of ingredients is unnaturally long - 16 lines (yes sixteen lines) of ingredients on the box, including fan favorite Corn Syrup. This is just an oatmeal cookie for crying out loud.<br /><br />And here's the bad nutrition: 170 calories per cookie, including 5% cholesterol, 12g sugars, 6% sodium (150mg). On the plus side, 4g of dietary fiber and 2g of protein. Other numbers from the label: 6g of fat (1.5g saturated), 27g total carbs, and single digit percentages of iron and calcium.

There's nothing better than a homemade cookie.  Having tried these and shared them with some co-workers I can honestly say that it's not just me that wasn't impressed.  There wasn't much said that was positive.  For being a soft baked cookie it tasted awfully dry.  It was almost more like a cereal bar rather than a cookie.  There was no yummy buttery taste.  They just weren't worth the 170 cals per cookie.  The only thing positive that was said is that it is convienient to have them separately packed for lunches and on the go snacks.

For a store bought cookie, they are very good.  There is nothing artificial tasting to them, they stay soft, but have a good chewy texture that holds together well.  They taste a little dry, but are not dried out or too brittle.  Most home made cookies dry out and turn brittle on me in a few days.  These hold up well.  The raising ratio seems just right, not too many but a very good balance of sweetness & wetness in the right places.  They are moderately sized, smaller that I would have guessed from the large picture and size on the box, but seemed filling enough because they were sufficiently dense.  They are not perfection compared to actual home baking fresh out of the oven, but relative to store bought cookies, and other oatmeal cookies, I thought they were very good.<br /><br />One thing to remember is that these are not as healthy as implied by all the good things promoted about using Quaker oats and being a good source of fiber.  They do have 16% fiber and pack in other good things, but they do carry 9% of your daily value of fat too, per cookie.  Compared to other cookies or snacks which offer no positives, these pack in good things along with the bad.  Just don't think consider them as good as just eating an apple without any fat.  But if the alternative is to pick up potato chips or other cookies, these at least pack in health benefits if you are going to eat such a snack anyway."

563870,B007JFMH8M,AES9VNGFZLOE1,Alexis McHenry,1,2,5,1342483200,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,"~ Quick Take: Tasty, chewy, soft-baked cookies with oats and raisins that the whole family can enjoy! =)<br />~ Usage Tips: Eat them as a snack, dessert or basically anytime of the day. They go well with a cup of tea or maybe with a cup of coffee in the morning.<br />~ The Verdict: Next time you're at the store, don't leave without picking up some Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies! They are good to take ""on-the-go"" since they are individually packaged. They are a healthy treat, provides a good source of fiber, contains 6 grams of total fat per serving, and made with whole grain Quaker Oats! You can't beat that! Try them out, I'm sure you'll love them as much as I did! =D"

It was big enough to split between my two daughters and it was a HIT with my super-picky eaters. I got a very small bite and loved it. It really did taste like something that could have baked in my own kitchen. I will definitely be buying more of these cookies and maybe next time I will get a whole one.

Like a very hint of molasses that was too old to use. If I had never had an oatmeal raisin cookie before and this was my first taste of one I would never try one again. QUAKER....pull these off the shelves of any store selling them and throw them in the garbage where they belong. This product gives Quaker a bad name. PLEASE.... don't waste your money on these and don't tell your kids they can have one for a treat, they are more like something you would give them for a punishment...."
563874,B007JFMH8M,A55PK06Q6AKFY,ephemeral,0,0,4,1343520000,Tastes Great,"These cookies are soft and delicious.  Possibly because they rely more on oat flour than just rolled oats, they lack the chewy texture of a traditional oatmeal cookie.  Instead they are almost melt-in-your mouth, with nicely soft raisins as well.  Perhaps the only truly detrimental characteristic is that they taste more like a raisin and spice cookie than an oatmeal cookie.  I enjoy the taste of oatmeal and wouldn't mind if it was brought more to the forefront.<br /><br />I don't usually buy individually wrapped food, so I don't think I'd buy this product again, but I would certainly recommend it to others."
563875,B007JFMH8M,A1YJMG0QJXZLD4,Rosemarie,0,0,5,1343520000,Very nice cookie,"I cannot say these taste like home made but the are not that far off. I like their chewiness and I am a crispy cookie person.  These are very tasty in fact they are too tasty I wanted to eat them all at once.  I would love to dip these I melted chocolate or make a sandwich cookie out of them by putting some kind of frosting or chocolate in the middle. Oh my would that be great.<br /><br />These are not too sweet they are just right basically in every way.  I like the fact that they come individually wrapped so you can put them in your lunch bag or send them with your children for their noon meal. Each cookie is 170 calories and that is not bad considering the size of them, they are quit big and should satisfy anyone's urge for a sweet treat.<br />I am very pleased with these cookies and would definitely buy them again."

The individual packing keeps them nice and moist and makes it easy to include one in a packed lunch.<br /><br />That said, they are not so special that I'd make an effort to seek them out. Also, the fact that each cookie is 170 calories would keep me from having them too often. Luckily, the individual packing will keep them fresh till you feel like having one."
